    """Represents the health of the stateful service replica.
    Contains the replica aggregated health state, the health events and the
    unhealthy evaluations.

    All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.

    :param aggregated_health_state: The HealthState representing the
     aggregated health state of the entity computed by Health Manager.
     The health evaluation of the entity reflects all events reported on the
     entity and its children (if any).
     The aggregation is done by applying the desired health policy. Possible
     values include: 'Invalid', 'Ok', 'Warning', 'Error', 'Unknown'

    :param health_events: The list of health events reported on the entity.

     current aggregated health state was returned by Health Manager.
    :type unhealthy_evaluations:
     list[~azure.servicefabric.models.HealthEvaluationWrapper]
    :param health_statistics: Shows the health statistics for all children
     types of the queried entity.
    :type health_statistics: ~azure.servicefabric.models.HealthStatistics

    :type partition_id: str
    :param service_kind: Required. Constant filled by server.
    :type service_kind: str
    :param replica_id: Id of a stateful service replica. ReplicaId is used by
     Service Fabric to uniquely identify a replica of a partition. It is unique
     within a partition and does not change for the lifetime of the replica. If
     a replica gets dropped and another replica gets created on the same node
     for the same partition, it will get a different value for the id.
     Sometimes the id of a stateless service instance is also referred as a
     replica id.
