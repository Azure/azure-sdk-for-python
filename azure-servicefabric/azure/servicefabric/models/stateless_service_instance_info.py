    """Represents a stateless service instance. This includes information about
    the identity, status, health, node name, uptime, and other details about
    the instance.

    :param replica_status: The status of a replica of a service. Possible
     values are following.
     -Invalid - Indicates the replica status is invalid. All Service Fabric
     enumerations have the invalid type. The value is zero.
     -InBuild - The replica is being built. This means that a primary replica
     is seeding this replica. The value is 1.
     -Standby - The replica is in standby. The value is 2.
     -Ready - The replica is ready. The value is 3.
     -Down - The replica is down. The value is 4.
     -Dropped - Replica is dropped. This means that the replica has been
     removed from the replica set. If it is persisted, its state has been
     deleted. The value is 5.

     values include: 'Invalid', 'Ok', 'Warning', 'Error', 'Unknown'
    :type health_state: str or ~servicefabric.models.HealthState

    :type node_name: str
    :param address: The address the replica is listening on.
    :type address: str
    :param last_in_build_duration_in_seconds: The last in build duration of
     the replica in seconds.
    :type last_in_build_duration_in_seconds: str
    :param service_kind: Constant filled by server.
    :type service_kind: str
    :param instance_id: Id of a stateless service instance. InstanceId is used
     by Service Fabric to uniquely identify an instance of a partition of a
     stateless service. It is unique within a partition and does not change for
     the lifetime of the instance. If the instance has failed over on the same
     or different node, it will get a different value for the InstanceId.
