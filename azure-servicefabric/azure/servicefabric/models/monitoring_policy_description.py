class MonitoringPolicyDescription(Model):
    """Describes the parameters for monitoring an upgrade in Monitored mode.

    :param failure_action: The compensating action to perform when a Monitored
     upgrade encounters monitoring policy or health policy violations. Possible
     values include: 'Invalid', 'Rollback', 'Manual'
    :type failure_action: str or ~azure.servicefabric.models.FailureAction
    :param health_check_wait_duration_in_milliseconds: The amount of time to
     wait after completing an upgrade domain before applying health policies.
     It is first interpreted as a string representing an ISO 8601 duration. If
     that fails, then it is interpreted as a number representing the total
     number of milliseconds.
    :type health_check_wait_duration_in_milliseconds: str
    :param health_check_stable_duration_in_milliseconds: The amount of time
     that the application or cluster must remain healthy before the upgrade
     proceeds to the next upgrade domain. It is first interpreted as a string
     representing an ISO 8601 duration. If that fails, then it is interpreted
     as a number representing the total number of milliseconds.
    :type health_check_stable_duration_in_milliseconds: str
    :param health_check_retry_timeout_in_milliseconds: The amount of time to
     retry health evaluation when the application or cluster is unhealthy
     before FailureAction is executed. It is first interpreted as a string
     representing an ISO 8601 duration. If that fails, then it is interpreted
     as a number representing the total number of milliseconds.
    :type health_check_retry_timeout_in_milliseconds: str
    :param upgrade_timeout_in_milliseconds: The amount of time the overall
     upgrade has to complete before FailureAction is executed. It is first
     interpreted as a string representing an ISO 8601 duration. If that fails,
     then it is interpreted as a number representing the total number of
     milliseconds.
    :type upgrade_timeout_in_milliseconds: str
    :param upgrade_domain_timeout_in_milliseconds: The amount of time each
     upgrade domain has to complete before FailureAction is executed. It is
     first interpreted as a string representing an ISO 8601 duration. If that
     fails, then it is interpreted as a number representing the total number of
     milliseconds.
