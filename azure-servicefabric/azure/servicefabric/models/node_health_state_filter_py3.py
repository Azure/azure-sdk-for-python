class NodeHealthStateFilter(Model):
    """Defines matching criteria to determine whether a node should be included in
    the returned cluster health chunk.
    One filter can match zero, one or multiple nodes, depending on its
    properties.
    Can be specified in the cluster health chunk query description.

    :param node_name_filter: Name of the node that matches the filter. The
     filter is applied only to the specified node, if it exists.
     If the node doesn't exist, no node is returned in the cluster health chunk
     based on this filter.
     If the node exists, it is included in the cluster health chunk if the
     health state matches the other filter properties.
     If not specified, all nodes that match the parent filters (if any) are
     taken into consideration and matched against the other filter members,
     like health state filter.
    :type node_name_filter: str
    :param health_state_filter: The filter for the health state of the nodes.
     It allows selecting nodes if they match the desired health states.
     The possible values are integer value of one of the following health
     states. Only nodes that match the filter are returned. All nodes are used
     to evaluate the cluster aggregated health state.
     If not specified, default value is None, unless the node name is
     specified. If the filter has default value and node name is specified, the
     matching node is returned.
     The state values are flag-based enumeration, so the value could be a
     combination of these values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator.
     For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches nodes with HealthState
     value of OK (2) and Warning (4).
     - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.
     - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to
     return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.
     - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is
     2.
     - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The
     value is 4.
     - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The
     value is 8.
     - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is
     65535. Default value: 0 .
