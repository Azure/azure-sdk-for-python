    """Describes the policy to be used for placement of a Service Fabric service
    where the service's Primary replicas should optimally be placed in a
    particular domain.
    This placement policy is usually used with fault domains in scenarios where
    the Service Fabric cluster is geographically distributed in order to
    indicate that a service's primary replica should be located in a particular
    fault domain, which in geo-distributed scenarios usually aligns with
    regional or datacenter boundaries. Note that since this is an optimization
    it is possible that the Primary replica may not end up located in this
    domain due to failures, capacity limits, or other constraints.
