# {{ package_pprint_name }} client library for Python
<!-- write necessary description of service -->

## Getting started

### Installating the package

```bash
python -m pip install {{ package_name }}
```

#### Prequisites

- Python 3.7 or later is required to use this package.
- You need an [Azure subscription][azure_sub] to use this package.
- An existing {{ package_pprint_name }} instance.

#### Create with an Azure Active Directory Credential
To use an [Azure Active Directory (AAD) token credential][authenticate_with_token],
provide an instance of the desired credential type obtained from the
[azure-identity][azure_identity_credentials] library.

To authenticate with AAD, you must first [pip][pip] install [`azure-identity`][azure_identity_pip]

After setup, you can choose which type of [credential][azure_identity_credentials] from azure.identity to use.
As an example, [DefaultAzureCredential][default_azure_credential] can be used to authenticate the client:

Set the values of the client ID, tenant ID, and client secret of the AAD application as environment variables:
`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`

Use the returned token credential to authenticate the client:

```python
>>> from {{ namespace }} import {{ client_name }}
>>> from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
>>> client = {{ client_name }}(endpoint='<endpoint>', credential=DefaultAzureCredential())
```

## Examples

```python
>>> from {{ namespace }} import {{ client_name }}
>>> from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
>>> from azure.core.exceptions import HttpResponseError

>>> client = {{ client_name }}(endpoint='<endpoint>', credential=DefaultAzureCredential())
>>> try:
        <!-- write test code here -->
    except HttpResponseError as e:
        print('service responds error: {}'.format(e.response.json()))

```
