XXXX-XX-XX Version 0.9.0

IMPORTANT CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR THAT AFFECTS TABLE STORAGE USERS:

The library now converts any datetime object in an entity to UTC before writing
the value to Azure, and it sets the timezone (tzinfo) to UTC on the entities
it reads from Azure. On a related note, python-dateutil is now an external
dependency.

The other changes in this release are:

  * Ability to pass in to management APIs a Session object from the requests
    library (or any compatible). This allows more flexibility for authentication,
    including oauth.
  * New service management APIs
    - list_role_sizes
    - list_subscriptions (oauth only)
    - rebuild_role_instance
    - delete_role_instances
    - create_reserved_ip_address
    - delete_reserved_ip_address
    - get_reserved_ip_address
    - list_reserved_ip_addresses
    - add_dns_server
    - update_dns_server
    - delete_dns_server
    - list_resource_extensions
    - list_resource_extension_versions
    - capture_vm_image
    - delete_vm_image
    - list_vm_images
    - create_vm_image (wip)
    - update_vm_image (wip)
  * Enhanced service management APIs
    - create_virtual_machine_deployment / add_role
      - custom data
      - additional windows unattend content
      - create from a vm image
      - public ips
      - resource extensions

      - provision guest agent
      - dns servers
      - reserved ip
    - update_role
      - resource extensions
      - provision guest agent
    - create_storage_service
      - account_type replaces geo_replication_enabled (preserved for backwards compat)
 * Preliminary Scheduler management API
 * Add metrics to Service Bus management API
 * Delete Blob - support for x-ms-delete-snapshots header 
 * Fixes for bugs:
   #221 Topic names containing slash
   #234 AttributeError on Timestamp property

   #116 def _from_entity_datetime(value) in __init__.py returns 7 for seconds
