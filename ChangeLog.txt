2015-05-13 Version 0.11.0

IMPORTANT CHANGE THAT AFFECTS STORAGE:

The API for creating shared access signatures has changed. The new API enables
easy production AND consumption of SAS for blob, queue and table storage.

 * To produce a SAS, use generate_shared_access_signature on
   BlobService/QueueService/TableService
 * To consume a SAS, init BlobService/QueueService/TableService with
   account_name & sas_token (no account_key)
 * For blob storage, you can now pass a sas_token to make_blob_url
 * For blob storage, you can now consume public containers/blobs, init 
   BlobService/QueueService/TableService with account_name only
   (no account_key or sas_token)

 See http://azure-sdk-for-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/storage.html for
 more details on using SAS with Azure Storage.

Other changes:

 * Create/list/delete job functionality added to SchedulerManagementService
 * update_site added to WebsiteManagementService to start/stop web sites
 * Target x-ms-version 2014-10-01 for service management
 * Add virtual IP fields in Deployment
 * Make cloud service create/delete async
 * Delete cloud service now supports deleting blobs from storage
 * Support for specifying SourceMediaLink for DataVirtualHardDisks

 * Fixes for bugs:
   #350 wait_for_operation needs to flush as it prints

Thank you to lmazuel, antonydenyer, zlike-msft, melor and amegianeg for their
contributions.

2015-04-28 Version 0.10.2
 * Fixes for bugs:
   #338 Version 0.10.0 fails with 'SocketReader' object has no attribute 'tell'

2015-03-13 Version 0.10.0

IMPORTANT CHANGE THAT AFFECTS STORAGE USERS (BLOB, QUEUE, TABLE):

The library now targets x-ms-version '2014-02-14' of the storage REST API.
Previous version of the library targeted '2012-02-12'.

The upgrade to this new version causes some breaking changes for Python SDK users:
 * Metrics for blob, queue, table service properties, which used to be accessed
   with the 'metrics' field are now accessed via 'hour_metrics' and 'minute_metrics'.
   Note that a backwards compatible 'metrics' property was added to redirect access 
   to 'hour_metrics'.
 * Url is no longer returned from list_containers, list_blobs, list_queues.
   For blob, you can use the utility function make_blob_url as an alternate
   way to get a URL.

See MSDN documentation for details on REST API changes
 in '2013-08-15': https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn592124.aspx
 in '2014-02-14': https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dd894041.aspx


The other changes in this release are:

 * Performance improvements in xml deserialization of storage and service bus
   Table storage query_entities is ~25X faster for the maximum of 1000 entities
 * Ability to upload and download blobs using multiple connections, along with
   retries when a chunk upload/download failure occurs
   Controlled via the max_connections, max_retries, retry_wait parameters
 * Use get_certificate_from_publish_settings to get a .pem certificate from
   your azure publish settings file
 * Ability to adjust the global http timeout
 * Service bus event hub support (create/update/delete hubs + send events)
 * Documentation for API Reference is now available at 
   http://azure-sdk-for-python.readthedocs.org/en/documentation/index.html

 * Fixes for bugs:
   #237 Ability to use multiple connections to upload blob chunks in parallel
   #254 Improve performance of table storage (and more?)
   #258 Support authenticating with azureProfile like in CLI tools
   #259 Unicode error is raised instead of actual error

okaram for their contributions.

2014-11-21 Version 0.9.0

IMPORTANT CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR THAT AFFECTS TABLE STORAGE USERS:

The library now converts any datetime object in an entity to UTC before writing
the value to Azure, and it sets the timezone (tzinfo) to UTC on the entities
it reads from Azure. On a related note, python-dateutil is now an external
dependency.

The other changes in this release are:

  * Ability to pass in to management APIs a Session object from the requests
    library (or any compatible). This allows more flexibility for authentication,
    including oauth.

    - list_role_sizes
    - list_subscriptions (oauth only)
    - rebuild_role_instance
    - delete_role_instances
    - create_reserved_ip_address
    - delete_reserved_ip_address
    - get_reserved_ip_address
    - list_reserved_ip_addresses

    - update_dns_server
    - delete_dns_server

    - list_resource_extension_versions
    - capture_vm_image
    - delete_vm_image
    - list_vm_images
    - create_vm_image
    - update_vm_image
  * Enhanced service management APIs

      - create from remote os image
      - provision guest agent
      - dns servers
      - reserved ip
    - update_role
      - resource extensions
      - provision guest agent
    - create_storage_service
      - account_type replaces geo_replication_enabled (preserved for backwards compat)
 * Preliminary Scheduler management API
 * Add metrics to Service Bus management API
 * Delete Blob - support for x-ms-delete-snapshots header 
 * Fixes for bugs:
   #221 Topic names containing slash
   #234 AttributeError on Timestamp property
   #212 Storage: Timstamp's microseconds value out of range
   #116 def _from_entity_datetime(value) in __init__.py returns 7 for seconds
