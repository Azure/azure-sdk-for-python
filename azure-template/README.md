# Azure Template Package

This template package matches necessary patterns that the development team has established to create a unified sdk functional from Python 2.7 onwards. The packages contained herein can be installed singly or as part of the `azure` namespace. Any other introductory text should go here.

This package has been tested with Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.

For a more complete set of Azure libraries, see the [azure](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure) bundle package.


# Usage

< This section should describe how to build your code and run the tests. >

This readme (with some setup in ops) should eventually be ingested to [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/).
