    following guidelines to decide between FAILED_PRECONDITION, ABORTED, and
    UNAVAILABLE:

        (a) Use UNAVAILABLE if the client can retry just the failing call.
        (b) Use ABORTED if the client should retry at a higher level (e.g.,
            when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client
            should restart a read-modify-write sequence).
        (c) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client should not retry until the
            system state has been explicitly fixed.

    generate OUT_OF_RANGE if asked to read from an offset past the current file
