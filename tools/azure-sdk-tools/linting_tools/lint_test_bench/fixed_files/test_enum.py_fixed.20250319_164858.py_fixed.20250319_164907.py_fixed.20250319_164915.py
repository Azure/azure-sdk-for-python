Sure, let's fix the pylint issues mentioned. But before proceeding, ensure that you have created and activated your virtual environment. Here’s how you can do that:

1. Create a virtual environment:
   
   <path_to_python_installation>/python.exe -m venv <environment_name>
   

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     
     .\<environment_name>\Scripts\activate
     
   - On macOS/Linux:
     
     source <environment_name>/bin/activate
     

Once your virtual environment is set up and activated, we can proceed to fix the pylint issues in the code.

### Issues
1. Enum members should be uppercase.
2. Enums should inherit from `CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta`.

### Fix
We will refactor `MyBadEnum` to inherit from `CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta` and ensure the enum members are uppercase. We will also check `MyGoodEnum2` to make sure it correctly uses uppercase enum members.

Here’s the corrected code:

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from enum import Enum
from azure.core import CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta

# Corrected: Enum members should be uppercase and enum should inherit CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta
class MyGoodEnum2(str, Enum, metaclass=CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta):
    ONE = "one"

# Corrected: Enum members should be uppercase and enum should inherit CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta
class MyGoodEnum(str, Enum, metaclass=CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta):
    ONE = "one"


To verify that the pylint issues are resolved, you should run pylint on your code. Run the following command in your terminal:


pylint <your_python_file>.py
