When dealing with Pylint issues like `docstring-admonition-needs-newline`, it is important to ensure the format of the docstring adheres strictly to the guidelines. You have already identified the warning, and you need to add a newline before the admonition.

Let's review and correct the docstring in your code:

class DeadClient:
    def get_function(self, x: int) -> int:
        """
        :param x: This is a parameter
        :type x: int
        :return: int y
        :rtype: int

        docstring

        .. admonition:: Example:
        
            This is Example content.
            Should support multi-line.
            Can also include file:
            .. literalinclude:: ../samples/sample_detect_language.py
        """
        y = x + 1
        return y


I've added a newline after the `docstring` text and before the `.. admonition::` block. This should fix the `docstring-admonition-needs-newline` warning.

Now, to check your code for other Pylint issues, please follow these steps:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   Open your terminal and run the following command based on your operating system to create a virtual environment:

    sh
    <path_to_python_installation>/python.exe -m venv myenv
    
   
2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - On **Windows**:
     sh
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     
   - On **Unix or MacOS**:
     sh
     source myenv/bin/activate
     

3. **Install Pylint:**
   With the virtual environment activated, install Pylint by running:
   sh
   pip install pylint
   

4. **Run Pylint on Your Python File:**
   Run Pylint to check for any other warnings or errors by executing the following command:
   sh
   pylint <your_python_file.py>
   

For detailed guidelines on running Pylint, you can refer to the [Pylint Checking guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/pylint_checking.md).
