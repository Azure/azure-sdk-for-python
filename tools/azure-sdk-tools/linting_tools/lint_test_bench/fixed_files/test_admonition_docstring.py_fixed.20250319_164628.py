To fix the `docstring-admonition-needs-newline` warning, a newline should be added after the `docstring` statement. Let's update the code accordingly:

class DeadClient:
    def get_function(self, x: int) -> int:
        """
        :param x: This is a parameter
        :type x: int
        :return: int y
        :rtype: int

        docstring

            .. admonition:: Example:
                This is Example content.
                Should support multi-line.
                Can also include file:
                .. literalinclude:: ../samples/sample_detect_language.py
        """
        y = x + 1
        return y


Here, I have added a newline before `docstring`.

Before running pylint to check if the issues are fixed, create a virtual environment if you haven't already and activate it. You can do this with the following commands:

sh
<path_to_python_installation>/python.exe -m venv <environment_name>


Activate the virtual environment and then run:

sh
pip install pylint


Finally, run pylint on your file to check for any other issues:

sh
pylint <your_python_file.py>


Refer to the instructions on [this website](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/pylint_checking.md) to ensure you're following the best practices while running pylint.
