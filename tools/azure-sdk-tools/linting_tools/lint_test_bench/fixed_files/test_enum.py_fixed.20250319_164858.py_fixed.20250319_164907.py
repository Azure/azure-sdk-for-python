Before we proceed with making changes to the code, please ensure you have a virtual environment set up and activated. You can do this with the following commands:

1. Create a virtual environment:

bash
<path_to_python_installation>/python.exe -m venv <environment_name>


2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:

     bash
     .\<environment_name>\Scripts\activate
     
   - On macOS/Linux:

     bash
     source <environment_name>/bin/activate
     

Once your virtual environment is set up and activated, let's fix the pylint issues in the code.

### Issues
1. Enum members should be uppercase.
2. Enums should inherit from `CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta`.

### Fix
Let's refactor `MyBadEnum` to inherit from `CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta` and ensure the enum members are uppercase. We'll also check `MyGoodEnum2` to make sure it correctly uses uppercase enum members.

Here's the corrected code:

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from enum import Enum
from azure.core import CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta

# Corrected: Enum members should be uppercase and enum should inherit CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta
class MyGoodEnum2(str, Enum, metaclass=CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta):
    ONE = "one"

# Corrected: Enum members should be uppercase and enum should inherit CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta
class MyGoodEnum(str, Enum, metaclass=CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta):
    ONE = "one"


To verify that the pylint issues are resolved, you should run pylint on your code. Run the following command:

bash
pylint <your_python_file>.py
