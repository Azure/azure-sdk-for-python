Before fixing the pylint issues, please ensure you have created and activated your virtual environment:

bash
<path_to_python_installation>/python.exe -m venv <environment_name>


Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
    bash
    .\<environment_name>\Scripts\activate
    

- On macOS and Linux:
    bash
    source <environment_name>/bin/activate
    

Now let's address the pylint issues mentioned.

**Problem: `client-does-not-use-static-methods`**

To fix the `client-does-not-use-static-methods` issue, we need to remove the `staticmethod` decorator. The class methods should be utilized appropriately within the class without making them static.

from typing import Any

class SomeClient:
    def __init__(self, credential: str, *, api_version: str ="2018", **kwargs: Any) -> None:
        """
        :param credential: The credential to use for authentication.
        :type credential: str
        :keyword api_version: The API version to use for the client.
        :paramtype api_version: str
        :keyword one: The first parameter.
        :paramtype one: str
        """
        self.credential: str = credential
        self._api_version: str = api_version
        self.one: str = kwargs.get("one")

    def _private_method(self) -> None:
        pass

    def create_configuration2(self) -> None:
        pass

class SomethingElse:
    def download_thing(self, some: int) -> int:
        some = some + 1
        return some


**Notes on changes:**
- Removed `@staticmethod` decorators.
- Corrected the `download_thing` method in `SomethingElse` to use type `int` instead of `str`.

Please run pylint on your code to ensure that the issues are fixed and there are no additional warnings:

bash
pylint <your_python_file>.py
