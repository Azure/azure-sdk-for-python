It looks like you are aimed at resolving Pylint issues and particularly an `async-client-bad-name` warning. To ensure proper naming conventions for asynchronous clients as mentioned, asynchronous clients should end with `AsyncClient`.

### Preparation
Before we proceed, please make sure you have created and activated your virtual environment:

1. Create the environment:
   bash
   <path_to_python_installation>/python.exe -m venv <environment_name>
   

2. Activate the environment:
   - On Windows:
     bash
     <environment_name>\Scripts\activate
     
   - On macOS and Linux:
     bash
     source <environment_name>/bin/activate
     

### Fixing Pylint Issues

Considering you need to rename the classes to follow the async client naming conventions, here is your updated code:

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from typing import Any

# Rename AsyncSomeClient to follow async client naming conventions
class SomeAsyncClient:
    def __init__(self, credential: str, *, api_version: str ="2018", **kwargs: Any) -> None:
        """
        :param credential: The credential to use for authentication.
        :type credential: str
        :keyword api_version: The API version to use for the client.
        :paramtype api_version: str
        :keyword eight: The eighth parameter.
        :paramtype eight: str
        """
        self.credential: str = credential
        self.eight: str = kwargs.get("eight")
        self._api_version: str = api_version

# Rename _AsyncSomeClient to follow async client naming conventions
class _SomeAsyncClient:
    def __init__(self, credential: str, *, api_version: str ="2018", **kwargs: Any) -> None:
        """
        :param credential: The credential to use for authentication.
        :type credential: str
        :keyword api_version: The API version to use for the client.
        :paramtype api_version: str
        :keyword eight: The eighth parameter.
        :paramtype eight: str
        """
        self.credential: str = credential
        self.eight: str = kwargs.get("eight")
        self._api_version: str = api_version

# Rename AsyncSomeClientBase to follow async client naming conventions
class SomeAsyncClientBase:
    def __init__(self, credential: str, *, api_version: str ="2018", **kwargs: Any) -> None:
        """
        :param credential: The credential to use for authentication.
        :type credential: str
        :keyword api_version: The API version to use for the client.
        :paramtype api_version: str
        :keyword eight: The eighth parameter.
        :paramtype eight: str
        """
        self.credential: str = credential
        self.eight: str = kwargs.get("eight")
        self._api_version: str = api_version


### Running Pylint

After making these changes, you can run Pylint to ensure no warnings related to the naming convention:

1. Make sure you are in the root directory of your project.
2. Run Pylint:
   bash
   pylint <your_python_file>.py
   

You can refer to [this website](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/pylint_checking.md) for additional information on running Pylint.

If you encounter further Pylint warnings or need more assistance, feel free to ask!
