First, create and activate a virtual environment:


<path_to_python_installation>/python.exe -m venv <environment_name>


Make sure your virtual environment is activated. Then, let's run pylint on the code to identify any issues:

1. Install `pylint` within the virtual environment:

pip install pylint


2. Run pylint on the script file (assuming it's named `approved_client.py`):

pylint approved_client.py


Review the output for any warnings or errors. Here are some common pylint issues and their fixes based on your given code:

**Example Pylint Issues and Fixes:**

1. **C0114: Missing module docstring** (missing-module-docstring):

   Ensure you add a module-level docstring at the top of your script.

2. **C0115: Missing class docstring** (missing-class-docstring):

   Add a docstring for the `ApprovedClient` class.

3. **C0116: Missing function or method docstring** (missing-function-docstring):

   Ensure each method has a docstring.

Here's how your code might look after addressing these common pylint issues:

After making these changes, re-run `pylint approved_client.py` and check for any remaining issues. If there are specific warnings you need help with, please provide the warning message, and I can assist you further based on that.
