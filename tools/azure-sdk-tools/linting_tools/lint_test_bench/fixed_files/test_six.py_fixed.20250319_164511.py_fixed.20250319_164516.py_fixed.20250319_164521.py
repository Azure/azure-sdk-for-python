Before running any Pylint commands, please make sure you have created and activated a virtual environment for your project. You can do so by following these steps:

1. **Create the virtual environment:**

sh
<path_to_python_installation>/python.exe -m venv <environment_name>


Replace `<path_to_python_installation>` with the path to your Python installation and `<environment_name>` with the desired name for your virtual environment.

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - On Windows:
   
     sh
     <environment_name>\Scripts\activate
     

   - On macOS and Linux:
   
     sh
     source <environment_name>/bin/activate
     

Now that your virtual environment is set up and activated, install `pylint`:

sh
pip install pylint


Then save your Python code to a file, assuming the file name is `legacy_code.py`. Here's the corrected code:


# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
# Licensed under the MIT License. See License.txt in the project root for license information.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

def legacy_operation() -> range:
    return range(10)


To run `pylint` on your file, use the following command:

sh
pylint legacy_code.py


For more detailed information on running Pylint and interpreting its output, refer to the official guide [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/pylint_checking.md).

Additionally, if you encounter any Pylint warnings, refer to the following resources to address them:
- Use the table in the [azure-pylint-guidelines-checker README](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-tools/blob/main/tools/pylint-extensions/azure-pylint-guidelines-checker/README.md) and the code examples as a guide.
- Refer to the Pylint documentation: https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/checkers/features.html.

If you need further assistance with specific Pylint warnings, feel free to ask!
