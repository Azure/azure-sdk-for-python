To ensure that you run and fix Pylint issues correctly, please follow these steps. First, let's validate and fix your provided code, followed by instructions on running Pylint. 

Here is the corrected implementation of your class adhering to Pylint rules:


# Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
# Licensed under the MIT License. See License.txt in the project root for license information.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This corrected code addresses the issues related to missing-client-constructor-parameter-credential 
# and missing-client-constructor-parameter-kwargs

class ClassNameClient:
    def __init__(self, credential, *, api_version: str = "2018", **kwargs) -> None:
        """
        :param credential: The credential used for authentication.
        :type credential: ~azure.core.credentials.TokenCredential
        :keyword eight: The eighth parameter.
        :paramtype eight: str
        :keyword api_version: The API version to use.
        :paramtype api_version: str
        """
        self.api_version: str = api_version
        self.credential = credential
        self.kwargs = kwargs


Explanation:
1. **Required Parameter**: `credential` has been added as a required parameter to the constructor.
2. **Arbitrary Keyword Arguments**: Added `**kwargs` to allow for extensibility and to handle arbitrary keyword arguments.
3. **Comment Fix**: Provided a multi-line docstring explaining the parameters and keywords for clear documentation.

### Steps to create a virtual environment, activate it, and run Pylint:

1. **Create Virtual Environment**:
    sh
    <path_to_python_installation>/python.exe -m venv <environment_name>
    

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
    - **Windows**:
      sh
      .\<environment_name>\Scripts\activate
      
    - **macOS/Linux**:
      sh
      source <environment_name>/bin/activate
      

3. **Install Dependencies**: (Make sure your `requirements.txt` or dependencies are specified correctly)
    sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    

4. **Check Pylint Documentation**: Refer to the project-specific Pylint documentation [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/pylint_checking.md).

sh
pylint <your_code_file>.py


### Guidelines on Writing SDKs:

Refer to the official Azure SDK design guidelines for Python [here](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python_design.html) for more comprehensive guidance on how to write SDKs effectively.
