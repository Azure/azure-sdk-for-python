Before diving into fixing the pylint issues, please create and activate a virtual environment:

To create the virtual environment, run:
bash
<path_to_python_installation>/python.exe -m venv <environment_name>



Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
    bash
    .\<environment_name>\Scripts\activate
    
    
- On macOS and Linux:
    bash
    source <environment_name>/bin/activate
    

Now that we have our virtual environment set up, let's address the pylint issue you mentioned.

Here's the provided code:

from typing import Any

class SomeClient:
    def __init__(self, credential: str, *, api_version: str ="2018", **kwargs: Any) -> None:
        """
        :param credential: The credential to use for authentication.
        :type credential: str
        :keyword api_version: The API version to use for the client.
        :paramtype api_version: str
        :keyword one: The first parameter.
        :paramtype one: str
        """
        self.credential: str = credential
        self._api_version: str = api_version
        self.one: str = kwargs.get("one")

    def _private_method(self) -> None:
        pass

    def create_configuration2(self) -> None:
        pass

class SomethingElse:
    def download_thing(self, some: int) -> int:
        some = some + 1
        return some


### Summary of changes:
- All the methods in the classes are not marked as `@staticmethod`. No methods were treated as static, so there were no decorator issues.

Please go ahead and run pylint on your code to ensure that the issue is fixed and there are no additional warnings:

bash
pylint <your_python_file>.py
