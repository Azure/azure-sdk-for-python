Sure, before proceeding, please create a virtual environment and activate it with the following commands:

sh
<path_to_python_installation>/python.exe -m venv <environment_name>


Activate the environment:

- On Windows:

sh
<environment_name>\Scripts\activate


- On macOS/Linux:

sh
source <environment_name>/bin/activate


After setting up the virtual environment, you can run pylint. For fixing the given pylint issue, there is a specific rule regarding checking API versions through keyword arguments. 

Here's the updated code to include the `api_version` as a keyword argument, which is a common requirement in Azure SDKs.

class ClassNameClient:
    def __init__(self, credential: str, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
        """
        :param credential: The credential to use for authentication.
        :type credential: str
        :keyword eight: The eighth parameter.
        :paramtype eight: str
        :keyword api_version: The API version to use.
        :paramtype api_version: Optional[str]
        """
        self.credential: str = credential
        self.eight: str = kwargs.get("eight")
        self.api_version: str = kwargs.get("api_version", "2021-01-01")  # Add default api_version if needed


By adding the `api_version` keyword argument, you comply with the common Azure SDK guidelines, which resolves the pylint warning regarding checking API versions via keyword arguments.

You can run pylint with the following command to verify that the issue is fixed:

sh
pylint <your_python_file>.py


Make sure to adjust any paths or filenames as necessary for your specific environment.
