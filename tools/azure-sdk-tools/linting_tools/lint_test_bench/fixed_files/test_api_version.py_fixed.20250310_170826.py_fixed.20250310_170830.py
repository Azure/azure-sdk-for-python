Based on the pylint error messages, the following issues are identified and fixed in the code:
1. `C0111 (missing-function-docstring)`: This warning is generated when a function is missing a docstring. In this case, the `__init__` method is missing a docstring.
2. `W0613 (unused-argument)`: This warning is generated when an argument is not used in the method. In this case, the `kwargs` argument is not used in the `__init__` method.

Here is the fixed code:


from typing import Any

class ClassNameClient:
    def __init__(self, credential: str, *, eight: str = None) -> None:
        """
        :param credential: The credential to use for authentication.
        :type credential: str
        :param eight: The eighth parameter.
        :type eight: str
        """
        self.credential = credential
        self.eight = eight
