It looks like the given code already addresses the `do-not-harcode-connection-verify` pylint issue correctly by accepting `connection_verify` as a parameter. However, there are a few minor improvements that can be made to enhance the readability and maintainability of the code.

Here is the code after some minor refactoring:

Make sure you have created and activated a virtual environment using below command:

bash
<path_to_python_installation>/python.exe -m venv <environment_name>

class FunctionKeywordArgumentsErrors:
    def create(self, x, connection_verify):
        if connection_verify:
            return x + 1
        return x

    def run(self, connection_verify):
        client = self.create(x=0, connection_verify=connection_verify)
        return client

# Example usage
# fkae = FunctionKeywordArgumentsErrors()
# result = fkae.run(connection_verify=False)


In this code, the `create` method takes `x` and `connection_verify` as parameters, and the `run` method passes the `connection_verify` parameter dynamically. The call to `create` within the `run` method has been updated to ensure the `x` parameter is also explicitly passed.

To run Pylint and ensure that the changes meet the required standards, please follow the instructions in the [Azure SDK Python Pylint checking guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/pylint_checking.md).

For more guidance on how to address specific pylint warnings, refer to the [Azure Pylint Guidelines checker table](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-tools/blob/main/tools/pylint-extensions/azure-pylint-guidelines-checker/README.md) and the official [Pylint documentation](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/checkers/features.html).
