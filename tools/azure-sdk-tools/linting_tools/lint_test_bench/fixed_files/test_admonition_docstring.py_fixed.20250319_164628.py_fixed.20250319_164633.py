You do need to create a `venv` and install `pylint` as reminded, but first let's fix the `docstring-admonition-needs-newline` warning within the `docstring` of your code.

The `docstring-admonition-needs-newline` warning requires a newline to be added after the actual docstring and before the admonition.

Here's your corrected code:

class DeadClient:
    def get_function(self, x: int) -> int:
        """
        :param x: This is a parameter
        :type x: int
        :return: int y
        :rtype: int

        docstring

        .. admonition:: Example:
            This is Example content.
            Should support multi-line.
            Can also include file:
            .. literalinclude:: ../samples/sample_detect_language.py
        """
        y = x + 1
        return y


I have added a newline before the `.. admonition::` statement within the docstring which will resolve the warning.

Next, follow these instructions to create a virtual environment, install `pylint` and check your code:

sh
<path_to_python_installation>/python.exe -m venv myenv


Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
sh
myenv\Scripts\activate


- On Unix or MacOS:
sh
source myenv/bin/activate


Install `pylint`:
sh
pip install pylint


Run `pylint` on your Python file:
sh
pylint <your_python_file.py>
