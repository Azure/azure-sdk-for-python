To fix the Pylint issues relating to `missing-client-constructor-parameter-credential` and `missing-client-constructor-parameter-kwargs`, you need to add the `credential` parameter and also support arbitrary keyword arguments (`**kwargs`), which are typically used for extensibility in client constructors.

Below is the corrected implementation of your class:


# Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
# Licensed under the MIT License. See License.txt in the project root for license information.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This code violates missing-client-constructor-parameter-credential and missing-client-constructor-parameter-kwargs
class ClassNameClient:
    def __init__(self, credential, *, api_version: str = "2018", **kwargs) -> None:
        """
        :param credential: The credential used for authentication.
        :type credential: ~azure.core.credentials.TokenCredential
        :keyword eight: The eighth parameter.
        :paramtype eight: str
        :keyword api_version: The API version to use.
        :paramtype api_version: str
        """
        self.api_version: str = api_version
        self.credential = credential
        self.kwargs = kwargs


Explanation:
1. Added `credential` as a required parameter in the constructor.
2. Added `**kwargs` to allow arbitrary keyword arguments in the function signature.
3. Removed the empty parentheses `()` from the class definition to make it a single colon `:`.

Before running Pylint on your code, ensure you have created and activated your virtual environment:


<path_to_python_installation>/python.exe -m venv <environment_name>


Activate your environment and install necessary dependencies. After that, you can check the project's pylint document for detailed references on how to run pylint as specified in [this website](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/pylint_checking.md).
