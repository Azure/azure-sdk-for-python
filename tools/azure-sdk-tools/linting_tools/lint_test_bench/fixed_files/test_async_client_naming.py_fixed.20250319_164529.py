Before we proceed with fixing the Pylint warnings, please make sure you have created and activated a virtual environment. You can create it using the following command:

bash
<path_to_python_installation>/python.exe -m venv <environment_name>


And activate it as follows:
- On Windows:
    bash
    <environment_name>\Scripts\activate
    
- On macOS and Linux:
    bash
    source <environment_name>/bin/activate
    

Now, let's proceed to fix the Pylint issues. In this case, the `async-client-bad-name` warning is likely related to naming conventions for asynchronous clients. According to the guidelines for naming async clients, they should end in `AsyncClient`.

Here are the modifications to address this issue:

After making these changes, you can run Pylint again to ensure that the warnings have been resolved. If you need further assistance with running Pylint, you can refer to this [website](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/pylint_checking.md).
