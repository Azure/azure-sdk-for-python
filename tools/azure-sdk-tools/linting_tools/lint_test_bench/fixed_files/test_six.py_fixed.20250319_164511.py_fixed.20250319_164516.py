It looks like you've addressed the Pylint warning related to importing the `six` library. However, you didn't include the original code that had the import statement. Assuming you have a simple example that imports `six` and uses it, I will show you how to address this issue fully with an example.

Here's an example of possible original code using the `six` library:


# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
# Licensed under the MIT License. See License.txt in the project root for license information.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

import six

def legacy_operation():
    if six.PY2:
        return xrange(10)
    else:
        return range(10)


We'll adjust this example to remove the `six` library usage:

1. Remove the import of `six`.
2. Use the native `range` function directly since you're targeting Python 3.

Corrected code:


# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
# Licensed under the MIT License. See License.txt in the project root for license information.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

def legacy_operation() -> range:
    return range(10)


This change eliminates the import of the `six` library and uses the built-in `range` function directly, addressing the Pylint warning `do-not-import-legacy-six`.

Now, let's check for remaining Pylint issues:

1. Make sure you have created and activated your virtual environment as mentioned earlier.
2. Then install `pylint`:
    sh
    pip install pylint
    

3. Finally, run `pylint` on your file. Assuming the file name is `legacy_code.py`:
    sh
    pylint legacy_code.py
    

For more detailed information on running Pylint, you can refer to the [Azure Python SDK Pylint guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/pylint_checking.md).
