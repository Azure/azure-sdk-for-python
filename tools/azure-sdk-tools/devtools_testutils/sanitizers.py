# This file contains methods for adjusting many aspects of test proxy behavior:
#
# - Sanitizers: record stand-in values to hide secrets and/or enable playback when behavior is inconsistent
# - Transforms: extend test proxy functionality by changing how recordings are processed in playback mode
# - Matchers: modify the conditions that are used to match request and response content with recorded values
# - Recording options: further customization for advanced scenarios, such as providing certificates to the transport
#
# Methods for a given category are grouped together under a header containing more details.

#
# - Uri
# - Header
# - Body

# request/response headers will be left unaffected.
