# Azure SDK Tools

This package is intended for usage in direct combination with the azure-sdk-for-python repo. It provides:

- Common test classes and functionality
  - `AzureRecordedTestCase` used for common record/playback functionality
  - `EnvironmentVariablePreparer` to allow recorded tests access to `New-TestResources.ps1`-created resources.
  - Test-Proxy Shim/Startup capabilities
- `Build` entrypoint
  - Previously in `scripts/devops_tasks/build_packages.py`
- `Versioning` entrypoints
  - Previously in `eng/scripts/versioning/*.py`

## Overview

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| `devtools_testutils` | Primary location for test classes, pytest fixtures, and test-proxy integration. |
| `ci_tools` | Various azure-sdk-for-python specific build and test abstractions. |
| `packaging_tools` | Templated package generator for management packages. |
| `pypi_tools` | Helper functionality build upon interactions with PyPI. |
| `testutils` | Backwards compatible extension of test classes. |

**PLEASE NOTE.** For the "script" entrypoints provided by the package, all should either be run from somewhere **within** the azure-sdk-for-python repository. Barring that, an argument `--repo` should be provided that points to the repo root if a user must start the command from a different CWD.

## Building Azure SDK Packages

After installing azure-sdk-tools, package build functionality is available through `sdk_build`.

```text
usage: sdk_build [-h] [-d DISTRIBUTION_DIRECTORY] [--service SERVICE] [--pkgfilter PACKAGE_FILTER_STRING] [--devbuild IS_DEV_BUILD]
                 [--produce_apiview_artifact] [--repo REPO] [--build_id BUILD_ID]
                 [glob_string]

This is the primary entrypoint for the "build" action. This command is used to build any package within the azure-sdk-for-python repository.

positional arguments:
  glob_string           A comma separated list of glob strings that will target the top level directories that contain packages. Examples: All == "azure-*",
                        Single = "azure-keyvault"

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DISTRIBUTION_DIRECTORY, --distribution-directory DISTRIBUTION_DIRECTORY
                        The path to the distribution directory. Should be passed $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory) from the devops yaml definition.If that
                        is not provided, will default to env variable SDK_ARTIFACT_DIRECTORY -> <calculated_repo_root>/.artifacts.
  --service SERVICE     Name of service directory (under sdk/) to build.Example: --service applicationinsights
  --pkgfilter PACKAGE_FILTER_STRING
                        An additional string used to filter the set of artifacts by a simple CONTAINS clause. This filters packages AFTER the set is built
                        with compatibility and omission lists accounted.
  --devbuild IS_DEV_BUILD
                        Set build type to dev build so package requirements will be updated if required package is not available on PyPI
  --produce_apiview_artifact
                        Should an additional build artifact that contains the targeted package + its direct dependencies be produced?
  --repo REPO           Where is the start directory that we are building against? If not provided, the current working directory will be used. Please
                        ensure you are within the azure-sdk-for-python repository.
  --build_id BUILD_ID   The current build id. It not provided, will default through environment variables in the following order: GITHUB_RUN_ID ->
                        BUILD_BUILDID -> SDK_BUILD_ID -> default value.
```

Some common invocations.

```bash

# build all package that have form azure-storage*. Set dev version for file + requirements before building.
sdk_build azure-storage* --devbuild=True

# build everything under sdk/core, dump into target directory
sdk_build azure* --service=core -d "<artifact_folder>"
```

## Using "versioning" modules

On top of assembling packages, azure-sdk-tools also can be used to complete various tasks with respect to version "maintenance". There are three primary entrypoints, and each fulfills a purpose in the repository.

### `sdk_set_dev_version`

```text
usage: sdk_set_dev_version [-h] [--service SERVICE] -b BUILD_ID [--repo REPO] [glob_string]

Increments version for a given package name based on the released version

positional arguments:
  glob_string           A comma separated list of glob strings that will target the top level directories that contain packages.Examples: All = "azure-*",
                        Single = "azure-keyvault", Targeted Multiple = "azure-keyvault,azure-mgmt-resource"

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --service SERVICE     name of the service for which to set the dev build id (e.g. keyvault)
  -b BUILD_ID, --build-id BUILD_ID
                        id of the build (generally of the form YYYYMMDD.r) dot characters(.) will be removed
  --repo REPO           Where is the start directory that we are building against? If not provided, the current working directory will be used. Please
                        ensure you are within the azure-sdk-for-python repository.
```

```

### sdk_increment_version

```

## Relevant Environment Variables

This package honors a few different environment variables as far as logging, artifact placement, etc.

| Environment Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `SDK_DEV_BUILD_IDENTIFIER` | Defaults to value "a". The character prefix before the build number when setting dev build versions. |
| `SDK_BUILD_ID` | When setting dev version, the current build number is passed to the function as an argument. For a local repro, that can be unwieldy, so the value from this environment variable is fallen back on. |
| `SDK_ARTIFACT_DIRECTORY` | If a given command invocation outputs to an artifact directory, and that directory is NOT provided via CLI args, azure-sdk-tools will fall back to this variable value. |

This set of environment variables will grow as more of the common functionality from azure-sdk-for-python is refactored into azure-sdk-tools.
