        This is a Python version of `Ruby's VCR
        library <https://github.com/vcr/vcr>`__.

        Rationale
        ---------
        
        VCR.py simplifies and speeds up tests that make HTTP requests. The
        first time you run code that is inside a VCR.py context manager or
        decorated function, VCR.py records all HTTP interactions that take
        place through the libraries it supports and serializes and writes them
        to a flat file (in yaml format by default). This flat file is called a
        cassette. When the relevant piece of code is executed again, VCR.py
        will read the serialized requests and responses from the
        aforementioned cassette file, and intercept any HTTP requests that it
        recognizes from the original test run and return the responses that
        corresponded to those requests. This means that the requests will not
        actually result in HTTP traffic, which confers several benefits
        including:
        
        -  The ability to work offline
        -  Completely deterministic tests
        -  Increased test execution speed
        
        If the server you are testing against ever changes its API, all you need
        to do is delete your existing cassette files, and run your tests again.
        VCR.py will detect the absence of a cassette file and once again record
        all HTTP interactions, which will update them to correspond to the new
        API.
