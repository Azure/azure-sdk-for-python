     address ranges specified by RFC1918
     INHERITED - Routes inherited from the real Virtual Network
     routes
     STATIC - Static route set on the web app only
     These values will be used for syncing a Web App's routes with
     those from a Virtual Network. This operation will clear all DEFAULT and
     INHERITED routes and replace them
     with new INHERITED routes.
