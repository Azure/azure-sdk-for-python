This project provides a set of Python packages that make it easy to
access Management (Virtual Machines, ...) or Runtime (ServiceBus using HTTP, Batch, Monitor) components of
`Microsoft Azure <https://azure.microsoft.com/>`_
Complete feature list of this repo and where to find Python packages not in this repo can be found on our 
`Azure SDK for Python documentation <https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/?view=azure-python>`__.

The SDK supports Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6.

If you're currently using the ``azure`` package < 1.0 then please read important information in `this issue <https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/440>`__.


INSTALLATION
============

You can install each Azure service's library individually:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install azure-batch          # Install the latest Batch runtime library
   $ pip install azure-mgmt-storage   # Install the latest Storage management library

Preview packages can be installed using the ``--pre`` flag:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install --pre azure-mgmt-compute # will install only the latest Compute Management library


You can also install a set of Azure libraries in a single line using the ``azure`` meta-package. 

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install azure

We publish a preview version of this package, which you can access using the `--pre` flag:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install --pre azure

The full list of available packages and their latest version can be found on our 
`documentation on docs.microsoft.com <https://docs.microsoft.com/python/azure/>`__
