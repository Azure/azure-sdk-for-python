This project provides a set of Python packages that make it easy to
access Management (Virtual Machines, ...) or Runtime (ServiceBus using HTTP, Batch, Monitor) components of
`Microsoft Azure <https://azure.microsoft.com/>`_
Complete feature list of this repo and where to find Python packages not in this repo can be found on our 
`Azure SDK for Python features chapter on ReadTheDocs <http://azure-sdk-for-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#features>`__.

The SDK supports Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6.

If you're currently using the ``azure`` package < 1.0 then please read important information in `this issue <https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/440>`__.


INSTALLATION
============

You can install each library individually for each Azure service:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install azure-batch         # Install the latest Batch runtime library
   $ pip install azure-mgmt-storage  # Install the latest Storage management library

Preview packages can be installed using the ``--pre`` flag:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install --pre azure-mgmt-trafficmanager # will install the latest Traffic Manager


You can also install a set of Azure libraries in a single line using the ``azure`` meta-package.
Since not all packages in this meta-package are
published as stable yet, the ``azure`` meta-package is still a release candidate and not final yet.
However, the core packages, from code quality/completeness perspectives can at this time be considered "stable" 
The ``azure`` package will be officially labeled stable in sync with other language SDKs as soon as possible. 
We are not planning on any further major changes until then.

**Since it's a preview release, you need to use the ``--pre`` flag:**

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install --pre azure
   
or directly

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install azure==2.0.0rc6

**The azure meta-package 1.0.3 is deprecated and no longer properly functions.**

The full list of available packages and their latest version can be found on our 
`installation page on ReadTheDocs <http://azure-sdk-for-python.rtfd.io/en/latest/installation.html>`__.

If you want to install all packages of the repo from source::

    git clone git://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python.git
    cd azure-sdk-for-python
    python setup.py install
