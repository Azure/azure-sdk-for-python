You will read the body of the github issue and follow the steps in the issue and provide the fixed code. If you need to curl the url to get the body, you should do that. If you are not sure about a specific warning, please leave it as is and do not attempt to fix it. Please request the user to provide the issue for the code that needs to be fixed.
