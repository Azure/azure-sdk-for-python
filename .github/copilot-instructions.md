# AZURE SDK FOR PYTHON - COPILOT INSTRUCTIONS

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### RULE 1: DO NOT REPEAT INSTRUCTIONS
**NEVER repeat instructions when guiding users. Users should follow instructions independently.**

### RULE 2: REFERENCE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION
**ALWAYS** reference the [Azure SDK Python Design Guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python_design.html)
- Link to specific pages when answering guidelines questions
- Use this as the authoritative source for SDK development guidance

### RULE 3: VERIFY ENVIRONMENT FIRST
**REQUIRED CONDITIONS:**
- To use Azure MCP tool calls, users must have PowerShell installed. Provide [PowerShell installation instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell) if not installed, and recommend restarting the IDE to start the MCP server.

## PYLINT OPERATIONS

### RUNNING PYLINT

**REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION:**
- [Official pylint guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/pylint_checking.md)
- [Tox formatting guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/tests.md#tox)

**COMMAND:**
```bash
tox -e pylint --c <path_to_tox.ini> --root .
```

**DEFAULT PATH:** `azure-sdk-for-python/eng/tox/tox.ini`

### FIXING PYLINT WARNINGS

**REFERENCE SOURCES:**
- [Azure pylint guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-tools/blob/main/tools/pylint-extensions/azure-pylint-guidelines-checker/README.md)
- [Pylint documentation](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/checkers/features.html)

**ALLOWED ACTIONS:**
‚úÖ Fix warnings with 100% confidence
‚úÖ Use existing file for all solutions
‚úÖ Reference official guidelines

**FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:**
‚ùå Fix warnings without complete confidence
‚ùå Create new files for solutions
‚ùå Import non-existent modules
‚ùå Add new dependencies/imports
‚ùå Make unnecessary large changes
‚ùå Change code style without reason
‚ùå Delete code without clear justification

## MYPY OPERATIONS

### RUNNING AND FIXING MYPY

**REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION:**
- [Tox guidance](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/tests.md#tox)
- [MyPy fixing guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/static_type_checking_cheat_sheet.md)

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- Use Python 3.9 compatible environment
- Follow official fixing guidelines
- Use tox mcp tool for running MyPy

## Python SDK Health tool

- Use the azure-sdk-python-mcp mcp tool to lookup a library's health status.
- Always include the date of last update based on the Last Refresh date.
- Explanation of statuses can be found here: https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/repo_health_status.md
- Release blocking checks are MyPy, Pylint, Sphinx, and Tests - CI. These checks should all PASS. If not PASS, mention that the library is blocked for release.
- If links are available in the table, make the statuses (e.g. PASS, WARNING, etc) you report linked. Avoid telling the user to check the links in the report themselves.
- Don't share information like SDK Owned

### Example

As of <Last Refresh date>, here is the health status for azure-ai-projects:

Overall Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS_ACTION

‚úÖ Passing Checks:

Pyright: PASS
Sphinx: PASS
Type Checked Samples: ENABLED
SLA Questions and Bugs: 0

‚ö†Ô∏è Areas Needing Attention:

Pylint: WARNING
Tests - Live: ‚ùì UNKNOWN
Tests - Samples: ‚ùå DISABLED
Customer-reported issues: üî¥ 5 open issues

‚ùå Release blocking

Mypy: FAIL
Tests - CI: FAIL

This library is failing two release blocking checks - Mypy and Tests - CI. The library needs attention primarily due to Pylint warnings, disabled sample tests, and open customer-reported issues.

## SDK release

There are two tools to help with SDK releases:
- Check SDK release readiness
- Release SDK

### Check SDK Release Readiness
Run `CheckPackageReleaseReadiness` to verify if the package is ready for release. This tool checks:
- API review status
- Change log status
- Package name approval(If package is new and releasing a preview version)
- Release date is set in release tracker

### Release SDK
Run `ReleasePackage` to release the package. This tool requires package name and language as inputs. It will:
- Check if the package is ready for release
- Identify the release pipeline
- Trigger the release pipeline.
User needs to approve the release stage in the pipeline after it is triggered.
