     feature to the LUIS underlying training algorithm. It is used as a lexicon
     lookup feature where its value is 1 if the lexicon contains a given word
     or 0 if it doesnâ€™t. Think of an exchangeable as a synonyms list. A
     non-exchangeable phrase list feature has all the phrases in the list serve
     as separate features to the underlying training algorithm. So, if you your
     phrase list feature contains 5 phrases, they will be mapped to 5 separate
     features. You can think of the non-exchangeable phrase list feature as an
     additional bag of words that you are willing to add to LUIS existing
     vocabulary features. Think of a non-exchangeable as set of different
     words. Default value is true.
