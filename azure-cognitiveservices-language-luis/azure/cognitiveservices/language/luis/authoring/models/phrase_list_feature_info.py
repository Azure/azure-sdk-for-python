     single feature to the LUIS underlying training algorithm. It is used as a
     lexicon lookup feature where its value is 1 if the lexicon contains a
     given word or 0 if it doesnâ€™t. Think of an exchangeable as a synonyms
     list. A non-exchangeable phrase list feature has all the phrases in the
     list serve as separate features to the underlying training algorithm. So,
     if you your phrase list feature contains 5 phrases, they will be mapped to
     5 separate features. You can think of the non-exchangeable phrase list
     feature as an additional bag of words that you are willing to add to LUIS
     existing vocabulary features. Think of a non-exchangeable as set of
     different words. Default value is true.
