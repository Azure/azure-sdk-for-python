# Getting Started
## Download Source Code

To get the source code of the SDK via **git** just type:

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python.git
cd azure-sdk-for-python
```

## Download Package

Alternatively, to get the source code via the Python Package Index (PyPI), type

```Shell
%SystemDrive%\Python27\Scripts\pip.exe install azure
```

You can use these packages against the cloud Microsoft Azure Services, or against
the local Storage Emulator (with the exception of Service Bus features).

1. To use the cloud services, you need to first create an account with Microsoft Azure. To use the storage services, you need to set the AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT and the AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY environment variables to the storage account name and primary access key you obtain from the Azure Portal. To use Service Bus, you need to set the AZURE_SERVICEBUS_NAMESPACE and the AZURE_SERVICEBUS_ACCESS_KEY environment variables to the service bus namespace and the default key you obtain from the Azure Portal.
2. To use the Storage Emulator, make sure the latest version of the Microsoft Azure SDK is installed on the machine, and set the EMULATED environment variable to any value ("true", "1", etc.)

# Usage
## Table Storage

To ensure a table exists, call **create\_table**:

```Python
from azure.storage import TableService
ts = TableService(account_name, account_key)
ts.create_table('tasktable')
```

A new entity can be added by calling **insert\_entity**:

```Python
from datetime import datetime
ts = TableService(account_name, account_key)
ts.create_table('tasktable')
ts.insert_entity(
     'tasktable',
     {
        'PartitionKey' : 'tasksSeattle',
        'RowKey': '1',
        'Description': 'Take out the trash',
        'DueDate': datetime(2011, 12, 14, 12) 
    }
)
```

The method **get\_entity** can then be used to fetch the entity that was just inserted:

```Python
ts = TableService(account_name, account_key)
entity = ts.get_entity('tasktable', 'tasksSeattle', '1')
```

## Blob Storage

The **create\_container** method can be used to create a 
container in which to store a blob:

```Python
from azure.storage import BlobService
blob_service = BlobService(account_name, account_key)
blob_service.create_container('images')
```

To upload a file 'uploads/image.png' from disk to a blob named 'image.png', the method **put\_block\_blob\_from\_path** can be used:

```Python
from azure.storage import BlobService
blob_service = BlobService(account_name, account_key)
blob_service.put_block_blob_from_path('images', 'image.png', 'uploads/image.png')
```

To upload an already opened file to a blob named 'image.png', the method **put\_block\_blob\_from\_file** can be used instead:

```Python
with open('uploads/image.png') as file:
  blob_service.put_block_blob_from_file('images', 'image.png', file)
```

To upload unicode text, use **put\_block\_blob\_from\_text** which will do the conversion to bytes using the specified encoding.

To upload bytes, use **put\_block\_blob\_from\_bytes**.

To download a blob named 'image.png' to a file on disk 'downloads/image.png', where the 'downloads' folder already exists, the **get\_blob\_to\_path** method can be used:

```Python
from azure.storage import BlobService
blob_service = BlobService(account_name, account_key)
blob = blob_service.get_blob_to_path('images', 'image.png', 'downloads/image.png')
```

To download to an already opened file, use **get\_blob\_to\_file**.

To download to an array of bytes, use **get\_blob\_to\_bytes**.

To download to unicode text, use **get\_blob\_to\_text**.


## Storage Queues

The **create\_queue** method can be used to ensure a queue exists:

```Python
from azure.storage import QueueService
queue_service = QueueService(account_name, account_key)
queue_service.create_queue('taskqueue')
```

The **put\_message** method can then be called to insert the message into the queue:

```Python
from azure.storage import QueueService
queue_service = QueueService(account_name, account_key)
queue_service.put_message('taskqueue', 'Hello world!')
```

It is then possible to call the **get\_messages** method, process the message and then call **delete\_message** with the message id and receipt. This two-step process ensures messages don't get lost when they are removed from the queue.

```Python
from azure.storage import QueueService
queue_service = QueueService(account_name, account_key)
messages = queue_service.get_messages('taskqueue')
queue_service.delete_message('taskqueue', messages[0].message_id, messages[0].pop_receipt)
```

## ServiceBus Queues

ServiceBus Queues are an alternative to Storage Queues that might be useful in scenarios where more advanced messaging features are needed (larger message sizes, message ordering, single-operaiton destructive reads, scheduled delivery) using push-style delivery (using long polling).

The service can use Shared Access Signature authentication, or ACS authentication.

Service bus namespaces created using the Azure portal after August 2014 no
longer support ACS authentication.  You can create ACS compatible namespaces with
the Azure SDK.

### Shared Access Signature Authentication

To use Shared Access Signature authentication, create the service bus service with:

```Python
from azure.servicebus import ServiceBusService

key_name = 'RootManageSharedAccessKey' # SharedAccessKeyName from Azure portal
key_value = '' # SharedAccessKey from Azure portal
sbs = ServiceBusService(service_namespace,
                        shared_access_key_name=key_name,
                        shared_access_key_value=key_value)
```

### ACS Authentication

To use ACS authentication, create the service bus service with:

```Python
from azure.servicebus import ServiceBusService

account_key = '' # DEFAULT KEY from Azure portal
issuer = 'owner' # DEFAULT ISSUER from Azure portal
sbs = ServiceBusService(service_namespace,
                        account_key=account_key,
                        issuer=issuer)
```

### Sending and Receiving Messages

The **create\_queue** method can be used to ensure a queue exists:

```Python
sbs.create_queue('taskqueue')
```

The **send\_queue\_message** method can then be called to insert the message into the queue:

```Python
from azure.servicebus import Message

msg = Message('Hello World!')
sbs.send_queue_message('taskqueue', msg)
```

It is then possible to call the **receive\_queue\_message** method to dequeue the message.

```Python
msg = sbs.receive_queue_message('taskqueue')
```

## ServiceBus Topics

ServiceBus topics are an abstraction on top of ServiceBus Queues that make pub/sub scenarios easy to implement.

The **create\_topic** method can be used to create a server-side topic:

```Python
sbs.create_topic('taskdiscussion')
```

The **send\_topic\_message** method can be used to send a message to a topic:

```Python
from azure.servicebus import Message

msg = Message('Hello World!')
sbs.send_topic_message('taskdiscussion', msg)
```

A client can then create a subscription and start consuming messages by calling the **create\_subscription** method followed by the **receive\_subscription\_message** method. Please note that any messages sent before the subscription is created will not be received.

```Python
from azure.servicebus import Message

sbs.create_subscription('taskdiscussion', 'client1')
msg = Message('Hello World!')
sbs.send_topic_message('taskdiscussion', msg)
msg = sbs.receive_subscription_message('taskdiscussion', 'client1')
```


## Service Management

### Set-up certificates

You  need to create two certificates, one for the server (a .cer file) and one for the client (a .pem file). To create the .pem file using [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org), execute this: 
```shell
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout mycert.pem -out mycert.pem
```

To create the .cer certificate, execute this: 
```shell
openssl x509 -inform pem -in mycert.pem -outform der -out mycert.cer
```

After you have created the certificate, you will need to upload the .cer file to Microsoft Azure via the "Upload" action of the "Settings" tab of the [management portal](http://manage.windows.com).

To initialize the management service, pass in your subscription id and the path to the .pem file.

```Python
from azure.servicemanagement import ServiceManagementService
subscription_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
cert_file = 'mycert.pem'
sms = ServiceManagementService(subscription_id, cert_file)
```

### List Available Locations

```Python
locations = sms.list_locations()
for location in locations:
    print(location.name)
```

### Create a Storage Service

To create a storage service, you need a name for the service (between 3 and 24 lowercase characters and unique within Microsoft Azure), a label (up to 100 characters, automatically encoded to base-64), and either a location or an affinity group.

```Python
name = "mystorageservice"
desc = name
label = name
location = 'West US'

result = sms.create_storage_account(name, desc, label, location=location)
```
  
  
### Create a Cloud Service

A cloud service is also known as a hosted service (from earlier versions of Microsoft Azure).  The **create_hosted_service** method allows you to create a new hosted service by providing a hosted service name (which must be unique in Microsoft Azure), a label (automatically encoded to base-64), and the location *or* the affinity group for your service. 

```Python
name = "myhostedservice"
desc = name
label = name
location = 'West US'

result = sms.create_hosted_service(name, label, desc, location=location)
```

### Create a Deployment

To make a new deployment to Azure you must store the package file in a Microsoft Azure Blob Storage account under the same subscription as the hosted service to which the package is being uploaded. You can create a deployment package with the [Microsoft Azure PowerShell cmdlets](https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/php/how-to-guides/powershell-cmdlets/), or with the [cspack commandline tool](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg432988.aspx).

```Python
service_name = "myhostedservice"
deployment_name = "v1"
slot = 'Production'
package_url = "URL_for_.cspkg_file"
configuration = base64.b64encode(open(file_path, 'rb').read('path_to_.cscfg_file'))
label = service_name

result = sms.create_deployment(service_name,
                     slot,
                     deployment_name,
                     package_url,
                     label,
                     configuration)

operation = sms.get_operation_status(result.request_id)
print('Operation status: ' + operation.status)
```
