Microsoft Azure SDK for Python
==============================

This is the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services Vision namespace package.

This package is not intended to be installed directly by the end user.

Since version 3.0, this is Python 2 package only, Python 3.x SDKs will use `PEP420 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420/>` as namespace package strategy.
This package will use `python_requires` to enforce Python 2 installation. This implies that you might see this package on Python 3 environment if you have pip < 9.0 or setuptools < 24.2.0.

It provides the necessary files for other packages to extend the azure.cognitiveservices.vision namespace.

If you are looking to install the Azure client libraries, see the
`azure <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure>`__ bundle package.
