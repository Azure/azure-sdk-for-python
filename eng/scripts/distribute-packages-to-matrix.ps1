.SYNOPSIS
Distributes a set of packages to a platform matrix file by adding computing and adding a TargetingString property
dynamically. If an unexpected situation is encountered, the script will make no changes to the input file.

.DESCRIPTION
Because of the way the platform matrix file is structured, we need to distribute the packages in a way that
honors the Include packages. We have these included this way because want to ensure that these python versions
run on that platform. This script is aware of these additional configurations and will set TargetingString for
them as well.

    # a basic platform matrix has the following:
    # "matrix" -> "PythonVersion" = ["3.6", "3.7", "3.8", "3.9", "3.10"]
    # "include" -> "ConfigName" -> "ActualJobName" -> PythonVersion=3.9
    # so what we need to do is for each batch
        # 1. assign the batch * matrix size to the matrix as "TargetingString", this will evenly distribute the packages to EACH python version non-sparsely
            # So direct packages add their duplicated targetingstring [ "azure-core,azure-storage-blob", "azure-core,azure-storage-blob", "azure-core,azure-storage-blob"]
            # a number of times indicated by the highest matrix multiplier. This forces a non-sparse coverage of this targetingstring batch
            # even in a sparse matrix generation.
            # indirect packages are then merely added as single additional targetingstring values (instead of multipled by the matrix multiplier)
            # which allows them to run on a single platform/python version combination
        # 2. assign the batch to each include with the batch being the value for TargetingString for the include
            # the easiest way to do this is to take a copy of the `Include` object at the beginning of this script,
            # for each batch, assign the batch to the include object, and then add the include object to the matrix object
            # this will have the result of multiplexing our includes, so we will need to update the name there as well
