    """Settings which specify how to run a multi-instance task.

    Multi-instance tasks are commonly used to support MPI tasks.

    All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.

    :param number_of_instances: The number of compute nodes required by the
     task. If omitted, the default is 1.
    :type number_of_instances: int
    :param coordination_command_line: Required. The command line to run on all
     the compute nodes to enable them to coordinate when the primary runs the
     main task command. A typical coordination command line launches a
     background service and verifies that the service is ready to process
     inter-node messages.
    :type coordination_command_line: str
    :param common_resource_files: A list of files that the Batch service will
     download before running the coordination command line. The difference
     between common resource files and task resource files is that common
     resource files are downloaded for all subtasks including the primary,
     whereas task resource files are downloaded only for the primary. Also note
     that these resource files are not downloaded to the task working
     directory, but instead are downloaded to the task root directory (one
     directory above the working directory).  There is a maximum size for the
     list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the request will
     fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this
     occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size. This can
     be achieved using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker Containers.
