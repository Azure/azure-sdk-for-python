class ComputeNode(Model):
    """A compute node in the Batch service.

    :param id: The ID of the compute node. Every node that is added to a pool
     is assigned a unique ID. Whenever a node is removed from a pool, all of
     its local files are deleted, and the ID is reclaimed and could be reused
     for new nodes.
    :type id: str
    :param url: The URL of the compute node.
    :type url: str
    :param state: The current state of the compute node. Possible values
     include: 'idle', 'rebooting', 'reimaging', 'running', 'unusable',
     'creating', 'starting', 'waitingForStartTask', 'startTaskFailed',
     'unknown', 'leavingPool', 'offline'
    :type state: str or :class:`ComputeNodeState
     <azure.batch.models.ComputeNodeState>`
    :param scheduling_state: Whether the compute node is available for task
     scheduling. enabled - Tasks can be scheduled on the node. disabled - No
     new tasks will be scheduled on the node. Tasks already running on the node
     may still run to completion. All nodes start with scheduling enabled.
     Possible values include: 'enabled', 'disabled'
    :type scheduling_state: str or :class:`SchedulingState
     <azure.batch.models.SchedulingState>`
    :param state_transition_time: The time at which the compute node entered
     its current state.
    :type state_transition_time: datetime
    :param last_boot_time: The time at which the compute node was started.
     This property may not be present if the node state is unusable.
    :type last_boot_time: datetime
    :param allocation_time: The time at which this compute node was allocated
     to the pool.
    :type allocation_time: datetime
    :param ip_address: The IP address that other compute nodes can use to
     communicate with this compute node. Every node that is added to a pool is
     assigned a unique IP address. Whenever a node is removed from a pool, all
     of its local files are deleted, and the IP address is reclaimed and could
     be reused for new nodes.
    :type ip_address: str
    :param affinity_id: An identifier which can be passed when adding a task
     to request that the task be scheduled close to this compute node.
    :type affinity_id: str
    :param vm_size: The size of the virtual machine hosting the compute node.
     For information about available sizes of virtual machines for Cloud
     Services pools (pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration), see Sizes
     for Cloud Services
     (http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-sizes-specs/).
     Batch supports all Cloud Services VM sizes except ExtraSmall. For
     information about available VM sizes for pools using images from the
     Virtual Machines Marketplace (pools created with
     virtualMachineConfiguration) see Sizes for Virtual Machines (Linux)
     (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-sizes/)
     or Sizes for Virtual Machines (Windows)
     (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-sizes/).
     Batch supports all Azure VM sizes except STANDARD_A0 and those with
     premium storage (STANDARD_GS, STANDARD_DS, and STANDARD_DSV2 series).
    :type vm_size: str
    :param total_tasks_run: The total number of job tasks completed on the
     compute node. This includes Job Preparation, Job Release and Job Manager
     tasks, but not the pool start task.
    :type total_tasks_run: int
    :param running_tasks_count: The total number of currently running job
     tasks on the compute node. This includes Job Preparation, Job Release, and
     Job Manager tasks, but not the pool start task.
    :type running_tasks_count: int
    :param total_tasks_succeeded: The total number of job tasks which
     completed successfully (with exitCode 0) on the compute node. This
     includes Job Preparation, Job Release, and Job Manager tasks, but not the
     pool start task.
    :type total_tasks_succeeded: int
    :param recent_tasks: The list of tasks that are currently running on the
     compute node.
    :type recent_tasks: list of :class:`TaskInformation
     <azure.batch.models.TaskInformation>`
    :param start_task: The task specified to run on the compute node as it
     joins the pool.
    :type start_task: :class:`StartTask <azure.batch.models.StartTask>`
    :param start_task_info: Runtime information about the execution of the
     start task on the compute node.
    :type start_task_info: :class:`StartTaskInformation
     <azure.batch.models.StartTaskInformation>`
    :param certificate_references: The list of certificates installed on the
     compute node. For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the
     certificates to the specified certificate store and location. For Linux
     compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a directory inside the task
     working directory and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is
     supplied to the task to query for this location. For certificates with
     visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's
     home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed
     in that directory.
    :type certificate_references: list of :class:`CertificateReference
     <azure.batch.models.CertificateReference>`
    :param errors: The list of errors that are currently being encountered by
     the compute node.
    :type errors: list of :class:`ComputeNodeError
     <azure.batch.models.ComputeNodeError>`
