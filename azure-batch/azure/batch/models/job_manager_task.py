class JobManagerTask(Model):
    """Specifies details of a Job Manager task.

    :param id: A string that uniquely identifies the Job Manager taskwithin
     the job. The id can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters
     including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than 64
     characters.
    :type id: str
    :param display_name: The display name of the Job Manager task. It need not
     be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of
     1024.
    :type display_name: str
    :param command_line: The command line of the Job Manager task. The command
     line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of
     shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take
     advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command
     line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
     MyCommand" in Linux.
    :type command_line: str
    :param resource_files: A list of files that the Batch service will
     download to the compute node before running the command line. Files listed
     under this element are located in the task's working directory.
    :type resource_files: list of :class:`ResourceFile
     <azure.batch.models.ResourceFile>`
    :param output_files: A list of files that the Batch service will upload
     from the compute node after running the command line.
    :type output_files: list of :class:`OutputFile
     <azure.batch.models.OutputFile>`
    :param environment_settings: A list of environment variable settings for
     the Job Manager task.
    :type environment_settings: list of :class:`EnvironmentSetting
     <azure.batch.models.EnvironmentSetting>`
    :param constraints: Constraints that apply to the Job Manager task.
    :type constraints: :class:`TaskConstraints
     <azure.batch.models.TaskConstraints>`
    :param kill_job_on_completion: Whether completion of the Job Manager task
     signifies completion of the entire job. If true, when the Job Manager task
     completes, the Batch service marks the job as complete. If any tasks are
     still running at this time (other than Job Release), those tasks are
     terminated. If false, the completion of the Job Manager task does not
     affect the job status. In this case, you should either use the
     onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have a client or
     user terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job
     Manager creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their
     execution. The default value is true. If you are using the
     onAllTasksComplete and onTaskFailure attributes to control job lifetime,
     and using the Job Manager task only to create the tasks for the job (not
     to monitor progress), then it is important to set killJobOnCompletion to
     false.
    :type kill_job_on_completion: bool
    :param user_identity: The user identity under which the Job Manager task
     runs. If omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the
     task.
    :type user_identity: :class:`UserIdentity
     <azure.batch.models.UserIdentity>`
    :param run_exclusive: Whether the Job Manager task requires exclusive use
     of the compute node where it runs. If true, no other tasks will run on the
     same compute node for as long as the Job Manager is running. If false,
     other tasks can run simultaneously with the Job Manager on a compute node.
     The Job Manager task counts normally against the node's concurrent task
     limit, so this is only relevant if the node allows multiple concurrent
     tasks. The default value is true.
    :type run_exclusive: bool
    :param application_package_references: A list of application packages that
     the Batch service will deploy to the compute node before running the
     command line. Application packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared
     directory, not the task directory. Therefore, if a referenced package is
     already on the compute node, and is up to date, then it is not
     re-downloaded; the existing copy on the compute node is used. If a
     referenced application package cannot be installed, for example because
     the package has been deleted or because download failed, the task fails
     with a scheduling error. This property is currently not supported on jobs
     running on pools created using the virtualMachineConfiguration (IaaS)
     property. If a task specifying applicationPackageReferences runs on such a
     pool, it fails with a scheduling error with code
     TaskSchedulingConstraintFailed.
    :type application_package_references: list of
     :class:`ApplicationPackageReference
     <azure.batch.models.ApplicationPackageReference>`
    :param authentication_token_settings: The settings for an authentication
     token that the task can use to perform Batch service operations. If this
     property is set, the Batch service provides the task with an
     authentication token which can be used to authenticate Batch service
     operations without requiring an account access key. The token is provided
     via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations
     that the task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For
     example, a task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to
     the job, or check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.
    :type authentication_token_settings: :class:`AuthenticationTokenSettings
     <azure.batch.models.AuthenticationTokenSettings>`
    :param allow_low_priority_node: Whether the Job Manager task may run on a
     low-priority compute node. The default value is false.
    :type allow_low_priority_node: bool
