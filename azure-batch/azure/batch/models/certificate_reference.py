     Windows nodes (that is, created with cloudServiceConfiguration, or with
     virtualMachineConfiguration using a Windows image reference). For Linux
     compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a directory inside the task
     working directory and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is
     supplied to the task to query for this location. For certificates with
     visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's
     home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed
     in that directory. Possible values include: 'currentUser', 'localMachine',
     'unmapped'
