    # operation, indicating whether it has succeeded, is inprogress, or has
    # failed. Note that this status is distinct from the HTTP status code
    # returned for the Get Operation Status operation itself. If the
    # asynchronous operation succeeded, the response body includes the HTTP
    # status code for the successful request. If the asynchronous operation
    # failed, the response body includes the HTTP status code for the failed
    # request and error information regarding the failure.
