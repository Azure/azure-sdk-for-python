Microsoft Azure SDK for Python
==============================

This is the Microsoft Azure Security namespace package. It provides the necessary files for other packages to extend the azure namespace.

This package is not intended to be installed directly.

This is a Python 2 package only. Python 3.x libraries will use `PEP420 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420/>`__ as namespace package strategy.
To avoid issues with package servers that don't support `python_requires`, an empty Python 3 package is installed.

If you are looking to install the Azure client libraries, see the
`azure <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure>`__ bundle package.
