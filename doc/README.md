# Documentation

This folder contains documentation for the Azure SDK for Python repository:

The folder structure is the following
- [sphinx](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/sphinx) : contains the documentation source code for https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-python/
- [dev](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev) : contains advanced documentation for _developers_ of SDK (not _consumers_ of SDK)

The file [eng_sys_checks](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/eng_sys_checks.md) is a read up as to what a standard `ci.yml` will actually execute.
