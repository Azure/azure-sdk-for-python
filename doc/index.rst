Azure SDK for Python
====================

Installation:
-------------

**The latest recommended release is currently a release candidate, tell this to pip to install it!**

The `azure` bundle meta-package will install all Azure SDKs at once:

- Use the ``--pre`` flag: ``pip install --pre azure``

- Specify the version:  ``pip install azure==2.0.0rc5``

You can also install only what you exactly need:

- Use the ``--pre`` flag: ``pip install --pre azure-mgmt-compute``

- Specify the version:  ``pip install azure-mgmt-compute==0.30.0rc5``

If you want to install ``azure`` from source::

    git clone git://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python.git
    cd azure-sdk-for-python
    python setup.py install

DISCLAIMER
----------

This is a release candidate. However, the core packages, from code quality/completeness perspectives can at this time be considered "stable" - 
it will be officially labeled as such in September (in sync with other languages).

We are not planning on any further major changes until then.

The following packages are still labeled "preview" but can be considered "stable":

- azure-mgmt-resource 0.30.0rc5
- azure-mgmt-compute 0.30.0rc5
- azure-mgmt-network 0.30.0rc5
- azure-mgmt-storage 0.30.0rc5

The following packages are already released as "stable" and are officially production ready:

- azure-batch 1.0.0
- azure-mgmt-batch 1.0.0
- azure-servicebus 0.20.3
- azure-servicemanagement-legacy 0.20.4

All other packages are real "preview" packages. Please send us your feedback!
