Quickstart Tutorial - Resource Management
===============================================================

We are excited to announce that a new set of management libraries are now generally available.
Those packages share a number of new features such as Azure Identity support,
HTTP pipeline, error-handling.,etc, and they also follow the new Azure SDK guidelines which
create easy-to-use APIs that are idiomatic, compatible, and dependable.

You can find the details of those new libraries `here <https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/mgmt/python.html>`__

In this basic quickstart guide, we will walk you through how to
authenticate to Azure using the new libraries and start interacting with
Azure resources. There are several possible approaches to
authentication. This document illustrates the most common scenario

Migration Guide
---------------
If you are an existing user of the older version of Azure management library for Python and you are looking for a migration guide to the new version of the SDK, please refer to `this migration guide here <https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/doc/sphinx/python_mgmt_migration_guide.rst>`__

Prerequisites
-------------

| You will need the following values to authenticate to Azure
 
- **Subscription ID**
- **Client ID** 
- **Client Secret** 
- **Tenant ID** 

These values can be obtained from the portal, here's the instructions:

Get Subscription ID
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Login into your Azure account
2. Select Subscriptions in the left sidebar
3. Select whichever subscription is needed
4. Click on Overview
5. Copy the Subscription ID

Get Client ID / Client Secret / Tenant ID 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For information on how to get Client ID, Client Secret, and Tenant ID, please refer to `this document <https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal>`__

Setting Environment Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After you obtained the values, you need to set the following values as
your environment variables

-  ``AZURE_CLIENT_ID``
-  ``AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET``
-  ``AZURE_TENANT_ID``
-  ``AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID``

To set the following environment variables on your development system:

Windows (Note: Administrator access is required)

1. Open the Control Panel
2. Click System Security, then System
3. Click Advanced system settings on the left
4. Inside the System Properties window, click the Environment Variables… button.
5. Click on the property you would like to change, then click the Edit… button. If the property name is not listed, then click the New… button.

Linux-based OS
::

    export AZURE_CLIENT_ID="__CLIENT_ID__"
    export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="__CLIENT_SECRET__"
    export AZURE_TENANT_ID="__TENANT_ID__"
    export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="__SUBSCRIPTION_ID__"

Authentication and Creating Management Client
------------------------------------------------------

Now that the environment is setup, all you need to do is to create an
authenticated client. Our default option is to use
**DefaultAzureCredential** and in this guide we have picked
**Resources** as our target service, but you can set it up similarly for any other service that you are using.

To authenticate to Azure and create
a management client, simply do the following:

::

    import azure.mgmt.resource
    import azure.mgmt.network
    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
    ...
    subscription_id = os.environ.get("AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID")
    credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
    resource_client = azure.mgmt.resource.ResourceManagementClient(credential=credential, subscription_id=subscription_id)
    network_client = azure.mgmt.network.NetworkManagementClient(credential=credential, subscription_id=subscription_id)

More detailed information and different authentication approaches using Azure Identity can be found in
`this document <https://docs.microsoft.com/python/azure/python-sdk-azure-authenticate>`__

Managing Resources
------------------

Now that we are authenticated, we can use the Resource client (azure.mgmt.resource.ResourceManagementClient) we have created to perform operations on Resource Group. In this example, we will show to manage Resource Groups.

**Create a resource group**

::

    location = "westus2"
    group_name = "my_resource_group_name"
    group = resource_client.resource_groups.create_or_update(
        group_name,
        {'location': location}
    )

**Update a resource group**

::

    group_name = "my_resource_group_name"
    group.tags = {
        "environment":"test",
        "department":"tech"
    }
    updated_group = resource_client.resource_groups.create_or_update(group_name, group)

**List all resource groups**

::

    group_list = self.resource_client.resource_groups.list()
    for g in group_list:
        print_resource_group(g)

**Delete a resource group**

::

    delete_async_op = resource_client.resource_groups.begin_delete(group_name)
    delete_async_op.wait()

Managing Network
------------------
We can use the Network client (azure.mgmt.resource.NetworkManagementClient) we have created to perform operations on Network related resources. In this example, we will show how to manage Public IP Addresses.

**Create a Network Public IP Address**

::

    GROUP_NAME = "testgroup"
    PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS = "public_ip_address_name"

    # Create Resource Group
    resource_client.resource_groups.create_or_update(
        GROUP_NAME,
        {"location": "eastus"}
    )

    # Create Public IP Address
    public_ip_address = network_client.public_ip_addresses.begin_create_or_update(
        GROUP_NAME,
        PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS,
        {
          "location": "eastus"
        }
    ).result()
    print("Create Public IP Address:\n{}".format(public_ip_address))

**Get a Network Public IP Address**

::

   public_ip_address = network_client.public_ip_addresses.get(
     GROUP_NAME,
     PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS
   )
   print("Get Public IP Address:\n{}".format(public_ip_address))

**Update tags in Network Public IP Address**

::

    # Update Public IP Address
    public_ip_address = network_client.public_ip_addresses.update_tags(
      GROUP_NAME,
      PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS,
      {
        "tags": {
          "tag1": "value1",
          "tag2": "value2"
        }
      }
    )
    print("Updated Public IP Address \n{}".format(public_ip_address))

**Delete a Network Public IP Address**

::

    # Delete Public IP Address
    public_ip_address = network_client.public_ip_addresses.begin_delete(
      GROUP_NAME,
      PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS
    ).result()
    print("Delete Public IP Address.\n")

Async and sync operations
-------------------------
In python>=3.5, Azure Python SDK provides the choice for user to use the asynchronous client for asynchronous programming.

Note that asyncio in Windows is underpowered and please take caution when using async operations on Windows systems

**Create Async Management Client**
::

    from azure.identity.aio import DefaultAzureCredential
    from azure.mgmt.network.aio import NetworkManagementClient
    from azure.mgmt.resource.resources.aio import ResourceManagementClient

    SUBSCRIPTION_ID = os.environ.get("SUBSCRIPTION_ID", None)
    credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
    resource_client = ResourceManagementClient(
        credential=credential,
        subscription_id=SUBSCRIPTION_ID
    )
    network_client = NetworkManagementClient(
        credential=credential,
        subscription_id=SUBSCRIPTION_ID
    )

**Create a Network Public IP Address Async**
::

    GROUP_NAME = "testgroup"
    PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS = "public_ip_address_name"

    # Create Resource Group
    await resource_client.resource_groups.create_or_update(
        GROUP_NAME,
        {"location": "eastus"}
    )

    # Create Public IP Address
    async_poller = await network_client.public_ip_addresses.begin_create_or_update(
        GROUP_NAME,
        PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS,
        {
        "location": "eastus"
        }
    )
    public_ip_address = await async_poller.result()
    print("Create Public IP Address:\n{}".format(public_ip_address))
