# SDK AI Guide - Getting Started

An AI agent to simplfy the workflows in the azure-sdk-for-python repo.

## Prerequisites

1. **Repository setup**: Open the azure-sdk-for-python repository at the root directory in VS Code
2. **MCP servers**: Ensure the azure-sdk-python-mcp server and azure-sdk-mcp server are running and connected in VS Code
3. **Package manager**: Install `uv` package manager (`pip install uv` or follow [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))
4. **GitHub CLI authentication**: Run `gh auth login`
5. **Feature branch**: Create a new branch with `git checkout -b <branch-name>`


## Where to Start

**The best starting point is understanding what you need to accomplish for your specific package:**

### ðŸ“‹ Quick Assessment Prompts

Start with one of these to get personalized guidance:

- `"What needs to be done to release azure-ai-projects?"`
- `"Help me create a PR for azure-cognitiveservices-textanalytics"`
- `"Check the health status of my package and show me next steps"`
- `"Check package release readiness for [package-name]"`
- `"I need to update [package-name] - what's the workflow?"`

**Copilot will assess your package's current state and guide you through the exact steps needed.**


## Common Workflows

### 1. New Package Generation

For creating a completely new SDK from TypeSpec:

- `"Generate a Python SDK using TypeSpec"`
- `"Start TypeSpec SDK generation for Python"`
- `"Generate SDK from tspconfig.yaml at <path>"`

### 2. Package Updates & Fixes

For existing packages that need updates or fixes:

- `"What validation issues does azure-ai-projects have?"`
- `"Fix the pylint warnings in my package"`
- `"Update my package to the latest TypeSpec version"`

### 3. Release Preparation

For packages ready for release:

- `"Prepare azure-ai-projects for release"`
- `"Check if my package is ready to release"`
- `"Update documentation and changelog for release"`

### 2. Follow Copilot's Workflow

Copilot will automatically:

1. **Assess your package** - Check current health status and identify blockers
2. **Verify environment** - Check dependencies and virtual environment
3. **Generate SDK** - Run TypeSpec generation (~5-6 minutes)
4. **Validate code** - Run Pylint, MyPy, Pyright, Verifytypes, Sphinx, Mindependency, Bandit, Black, Samples, Breaking changes (~3-5 minutes each)
5. **Update docs** - Create/update CHANGELOG.md and version files
6. **Commit changes** - Add, commit, and push to your branch
7. **Create PR** - Generate pull request in draft mode
8. **Handoff** - Provide PR link for azure-rest-api-specs agent

## Package Health & Release Readiness

**Start here to understand what your package needs:**

### Health Status Check
```
What is the health status of azure-ai-projects?
```

This reports the library's status from [aka.ms/azsdk/python/health](https://www.aka.ms/azsdk/python/health) and identifies:
- Release blocking issues
- Validation failures that need fixing
- Missing documentation or tests
- Recommended next steps

### Release Readiness Check
```
Check package release readiness for azure-ai-projects
```

This comprehensive check includes:
- Pipeline status verification
- APIView review status
- Changelog validation
- Namespace approval status
- All release-blocking requirements

### 3. Your Actions

- Provide file paths when requested
- Review and approve code changes
- Confirm commit messages
- Review PR title and description

## Expected Timeline

- **Total time**: 10-15 minutes
- **SDK Generation**: 5-6 minutes
- **Validation**: 3-5 minutes per step
- **Documentation**: 2-4 minutes

## Next Steps

After PR creation, if working through the release plan steps with the DevEx agent, use the **azure-rest-api-specs agent** with your PR link to complete the release process.

## Useful Prompts

### Package Assessment (Start Here!)

**Check what your package needs:**
```
"What needs to be done to release azure-ai-projects?"
"Help me create a PR for azure-cognitiveservices-textanalytics"
"What is the health status of my package?"
"Check package release readiness for azure-storage-blob"
"Check if azure-storage-blob is ready for release"
```

### Starting SDK Generation

**Basic generation:**
```
"Generate a Python SDK using TypeSpec"
"Start TypeSpec SDK generation workflow"
```

**With local TypeSpec project:**
```
"Generate SDK from my local TypeSpec project at sdk/cognitiveservices/azure-ai-projects"
"I have a tspconfig.yaml at [path], generate the Python SDK"
```

**With remote TypeSpec:**
```
"Generate SDK from TypeSpec at https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/specification/ai/Azure.AI.Projects/tspconfig.yaml"
```

### Validation and Fixes

**Fix validation issues:**
```
"Fix the pylint warnings in my generated SDK"
"Help me resolve mypy errors"
"Run all validation steps and fix any issues"
```

**Check specific validations:**
```
"Run only pylint validation"
"Check if my SDK passes pyright validation"
```

### Documentation and Release

**Update documentation:**
```
"Update the CHANGELOG.md for my new SDK"
"Set the correct version in _version.py"
```

**Commit and PR:**
```
"Commit my changes and create a pull request"
"Push my SDK changes to a new branch"
```

### Health and Status

**Check library health:**
```
"What is the health status of azure-ai-projects?"
"Show me the CI status for my library"
```

**Check release readiness:**
```
"Check package release readiness for azure-ai-projects"
"Is azure-cognitiveservices-textanalytics ready to release?"
"Verify all release requirements for my package"
```
