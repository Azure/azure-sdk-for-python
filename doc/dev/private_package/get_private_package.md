# Get Private Package

This guide is to help Python SDK users to get private package. Just follow the steps:

## 1. Confirm default tag

Make sure your target tag is defined in `readme.md` and **default tag is same with your target tag**. For example:

[azure-rest-api-specs/specification/network/resource-manager at main Â· Azure/azure-rest-api-specs (github.com)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/main/specification/network/resource-manager#basic-information)

## 2.Configure `readme.python.md`

If there is no `Python multi-api` in `readme.python.md`(i.e.  [datadog](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/specification/datadog/resource-manager/readme.python.md)), skip this step.

If there is `Python multi-api` in `readme.python.md` (i.e. [network](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/specification/network/resource-manager/readme.python.md#python-multi-api)), you need additional configuration: [Python Multiapi Configuration](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/private_package/python_multiapi_configuration.md)

## 3.Trigger pipeline

Submit a PR or draft  PR to [Azure/azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs)

If there is no link in the figure above, it may be folded. You can also find it in the `Checks`.

# Note

## 1.private repo

In private repo [Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr), pipeline can be triggered **only when the target branch is `main`**
