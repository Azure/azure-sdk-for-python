## MyPy

[MyPy](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/) is a static analyzer for type checking.

### Opt-in
To opt-in, add the package name to the end of the [`mypy_hard_failure_packages.py`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/eng/tox/mypy_hard_failure_packages.py) file:

```python
MYPY_HARD_FAILURE_OPTED = [
    ...,
    "azure-my-package",
]
```

### Running locally
MyPy can be run using tox.

```bash
tox -c ../../../eng/tox/tox.ini -e mypy
```

## black

[black](https://pypi.org/project/black) is an opinionated code formatter for Python source code.

### Opt-in

Make the following change to your projects `ci.yml`:

```yml
extends:
    template: ../../eng/pipelines/templates/stages/archetype-sdk-client.yml
    parameters:
        ...
        ValidateFormatting: true
        ...
```

### Running locally
To run locally first install `black` from pip if you do not have it already (the pipeline uses version 21.6b0). Currently, we use the `-l 120` option to allow lines up to 120 characters (consistent with our `pylint` check).
```bash
python -m pip install black==21.6b0
python -m black -l 120 <path/to/service_directory>
```

## Autorest Automation
This check will automatically create PRs with updated generated code whenever autorest has made an update that results in a change to the generated code for a package. Note: this check only runs in nightly CI checks.

### Opt-in

Make the following change to your projects `ci.yml`:

```yml
extends:
    template: ../../eng/pipelines/templates/stages/archetype-sdk-client.yml
    parameters:
        ...
        VerifyAutorest: true
        ...
```

### Running locally

To run autorest automation locally run the following command from the home of `azure-sdk-for-python`
```bash
azure-sdk-for-python> python scripts/devop_tasks/verify_autorest.py --service_directory <your_service_directory>
```
