# Release History

## 2.0.0 (2019-12-25)

**Features**

  - Added operation AppsOperations.list_templates

**General Breaking Changes**

This version uses a next-generation code generator that might introduce
breaking changes if from some import. In summary, some modules were
incorrectly visible/importable and have been renamed. This fixed several
issues caused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be used in
the first place. IoTCentralClient cannot be imported from
azure.mgmt.iotcentreal.iot_central_client anymore (import from
azure.mgmt.iotcentreal works like before) IoTCentralClientConfiguration
import has been moved from azure.mgmt.iotcentreal.iot_central_client
to azure.mgmt.iotcentreal A model MyClass from a "models" sub-module
cannot be imported anymore using azure.mgmt.iotcentreal.models.my_class
(import from azure.mgmt.iotcentreal.models works like before) An
operation class MyClassOperations from an operations sub-module cannot
be imported anymore using
azure.mgmt.iotcentreal.operations.my_class_operations (import from
azure.mgmt.iotcentreal.operations works like before) Last but not least,
HTTP connection pooling is now enabled by default. You should always use
a client as a context manager, or call close(), or use no more than one
client per process.
