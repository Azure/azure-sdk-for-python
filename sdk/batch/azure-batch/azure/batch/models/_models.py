class BatchJobManagerTask(_model_base.Model):
    """Specifies details of a Job Manager Task.
    The Job Manager Task is automatically started when the Job is created. The
    Batch service tries to schedule the Job Manager Task before any other Tasks in
    the Job. When shrinking a Pool, the Batch service tries to preserve Nodes where
    Job Manager Tasks are running for as long as possible (that is, Compute Nodes
    running 'normal' Tasks are removed before Compute Nodes running Job Manager
    Tasks). When a Job Manager Task fails and needs to be restarted, the system
    tries to schedule it at the highest priority. If there are no idle Compute
    Nodes available, the system may terminate one of the running Tasks in the Pool
    and return it to the queue in order to make room for the Job Manager Task to
    restart. Note that a Job Manager Task in one Job does not have priority over
    Tasks in other Jobs. Across Jobs, only Job level priorities are observed. For
    example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 Job needs to be restarted, it will
    not displace Tasks of a priority 1 Job. Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery
    operation is triggered on a Node. Examples of recovery operations include (but
    are not limited to) when an unhealthy Node is rebooted or a Compute Node
    disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery operations are
    independent of and are not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the
    maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may
    occur. Because of this, all Tasks should be idempotent. This means Tasks need
    to tolerate being interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or
    duplicate data. The best practice for long running Tasks is to use some form of
    checkpointing.

    :ivar id: A string that uniquely identifies the Job Manager Task within the Job. The ID can

     under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment
     variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell
     in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand"
     in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to
     the Task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable
     (`https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables

     If the Pool that will run this Task has containerConfiguration set, this must be set as well.

     set. When this is specified, all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the
     root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all Task
     environment variables are mapped into the container, and the Task command line is executed in
     the container. Files produced in the container outside of AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR might not be
     reflected to the host disk, meaning that Batch file APIs will not be able to access those
     files.
    :vartype container_settings: ~azure.batch.models.BatchTaskContainerSettings
    :ivar resource_files: A list of files that the Batch service will download to the Compute Node
     before running the command line. Files listed under this element are located in the Task's
     working directory. There is a maximum size for the list of resource files.  When the max size
     is exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge.
     If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size. This can be achieved
     using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker Containers.

    :vartype required_slots: int
    :ivar kill_job_on_completion: Whether completion of the Job Manager Task signifies completion
     of the entire Job. If true, when the Job Manager Task completes, the Batch service marks the
     Job as complete. If any Tasks are still running at this time (other than Job Release), those
     Tasks are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job Manager Task does not affect the Job
     status. In this case, you should either use the onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the
     Job, or have a client or user terminate the Job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job
     Manager creates a set of Tasks but then takes no further role in their execution. The default
     value is true. If you are using the onAllTasksComplete and onTaskFailure attributes to control
     Job lifetime, and using the Job Manager Task only to create the Tasks for the Job (not to
     monitor progress), then it is important to set killJobOnCompletion to false.

     where it runs. If true, no other Tasks will run on the same Node for as long as the Job Manager
     is running. If false, other Tasks can run simultaneously with the Job Manager on a Compute
     Node. The Job Manager Task counts normally against the Compute Node's concurrent Task limit, so
     this is only relevant if the Compute Node allows multiple concurrent Tasks. The default value

     directory. Therefore, if a referenced Application Package is already
     on the Compute Node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded;
     the existing copy on the Compute Node is used. If a referenced Application

    :ivar authentication_token_settings: The settings for an authentication token that the Task can

     operations without requiring an Account access key. The token is provided via the
     AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations that the Task can carry out
     using the token depend on the settings. For example, a Task can request Job permissions in

class BatchJobPreparationTask(_model_base.Model):
    """A Job Preparation Task to run before any Tasks of the Job on any given Compute Node.
    You can use Job Preparation to prepare a Node to run Tasks for the Job.
    Activities commonly performed in Job Preparation include: Downloading common
    resource files used by all the Tasks in the Job. The Job Preparation Task can
    download these common resource files to the shared location on the Node.
    (AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR\\shared), or starting a local service on the Node so
    that all Tasks of that Job can communicate with it. If the Job Preparation Task
    fails (that is, exhausts its retry count before exiting with exit code 0),
    Batch will not run Tasks of this Job on the Node. The Compute Node remains
    ineligible to run Tasks of this Job until it is reimaged. The Compute Node
    remains active and can be used for other Jobs. The Job Preparation Task can run
    multiple times on the same Node. Therefore, you should write the Job
    Preparation Task to handle re-execution. If the Node is rebooted, the Job
    Preparation Task is run again on the Compute Node before scheduling any other
    Task of the Job, if rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess is true or if the Job
    Preparation Task did not previously complete. If the Node is reimaged, the Job
    Preparation Task is run again before scheduling any Task of the Job. Batch will
    retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node. Examples of
    recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy Node is
    rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to
    recovery operations are independent of and are not counted against the
    maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to
    a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all Tasks should be
    idempotent. This means Tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and restarted
    without causing any corruption or duplicate data. The best practice for long
    running Tasks is to use some form of checkpointing.

    :ivar id: A string that uniquely identifies the Job Preparation Task within the Job. The ID can
     contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot
     contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property, the Batch service assigns
     a default value of 'jobpreparation'. No other Task in the Job can have the same ID as the Job
     Preparation Task. If you try to submit a Task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the
     request with error code TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask; if you are calling the REST API
     directly, the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
    :vartype id: str
    :ivar command_line: The command line of the Job Preparation Task. The command line does not run
     under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment
     variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell
     in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand"
     in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to
     the Task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable

     environment variables are mapped into the container, and the Task command line is executed in

     before running the command line. Files listed under this element are located in the Task's

     is exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge.

     Preparation Task has completed successfully if it exits with exit code 0. If true and the Job
     Preparation Task fails on a Node, the Batch service retries the Job Preparation Task up to its
     maximum retry count (as specified in the constraints element). If the Task has still not
     completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule Tasks of the
     Job to the Node. The Node remains active and eligible to run Tasks of other Jobs. If false, the

    still active, the Job's maximum wall clock time constraint is reached, and the
    Job is still active, or the Job's Job Manager Task completed, and the Job is
    configured to terminate when the Job Manager completes. The Job Release Task
    runs on each Node where Tasks of the Job have run and the Job Preparation Task
    ran and completed. If you reimage a Node after it has run the Job Preparation
    Task, and the Job ends without any further Tasks of the Job running on that
    Node (and hence the Job Preparation Task does not re-run), then the Job Release
    Task does not run on that Compute Node. If a Node reboots while the Job Release
    Task is still running, the Job Release Task runs again when the Compute Node
    starts up. The Job is not marked as complete until all Job Release Tasks have
    completed. The Job Release Task runs in the background. It does not occupy a
    scheduling slot; that is, it does not count towards the taskSlotsPerNode limit
    specified on the Pool.

    :ivar id: A string that uniquely identifies the Job Release Task within the Job. The ID can
     contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot
     contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property, the Batch service assigns
     a default value of 'jobrelease'. No other Task in the Job can have the same ID as the Job
     Release Task. If you try to submit a Task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the
     request with error code TaskIdSameAsJobReleaseTask; if you are calling the REST API directly,
     the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
    :vartype id: str
    :ivar command_line: The command line of the Job Release Task. The command line does not run
     under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment
     variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell
     in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand"
     in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to
     the Task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable
     (`https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables

     variables are mapped into the container, and the Task command line is executed in the
     container. Files produced in the container outside of AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR might not be

     RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size.

     may not specify a timeout longer than 15 minutes. If you do, the Batch service rejects it with

     Compute Node is removed or the Job is deleted.

    Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not counted
    against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal
    retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all Tasks should
    be idempotent. This means Tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and

     limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the Task up to 4 times (one
     initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
     the Task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the Task without limit,

     the coordination command line. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore
     cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to
     take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example
     using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line
     refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the Task working directory),
     or use the Batch provided environment variable
     (`https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables

     this is specified, all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of
     Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all Task environment
     variables are mapped into the container, and the Task command line is executed in the
     container. Files produced in the container outside of AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR might not be
     reflected to the host disk, meaning that Batch file APIs will not be able to access those
     files.
    :vartype container_settings: ~azure.batch.models.BatchTaskContainerSettings

     before running the command line. For multi-instance Tasks, the resource files will only be

     for the list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the request will fail and the
     response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of
     ResourceFiles must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files, Application

    :ivar application_package_references: A list of Packages that the Batch service will deploy to
     the Compute Node before running the command line. Application packages are downloaded and
     deployed to a shared directory, not the Task working directory. Therefore, if a referenced
     package is already on the Node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing
     copy on the Compute Node is used. If a referenced Package cannot be installed, for example
     because the package has been deleted or because download failed, the Task fails.

     use to perform Batch service operations. If this property is set, the Batch service provides
     the Task with an authentication token which can be used to authenticate Batch service
     operations without requiring an Account access key. The token is provided via the
     AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations that the Task can carry out
     using the token depend on the settings. For example, a Task can request Job permissions in
