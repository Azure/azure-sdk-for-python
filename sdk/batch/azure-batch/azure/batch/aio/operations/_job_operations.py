                          Job's onAllTasksComplete attribute is set to terminatejob, and all Tasks in
                          the Job are complete. TaskFailed - the Job's onTaskFailure attribute is set
                          to performExitOptionsJobAction, and a Task in the Job failed with an exit
                          condition that specified a jobAction of terminatejob. Any other string is a

                              to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the Task once, and may
                              then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is
                              3, Batch tries the Task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If
                              the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the Task
                              after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
                              service retries the Task without limit, however this is not recommended
                              for a start task or any task. The default value is 0 (no retries).

                          Manager Task completes, the Batch service marks the Job as complete. If any
                          Tasks are still running at this time (other than Job Release), those Tasks
                          are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job Manager Task does not
                          affect the Job status. In this case, you should either use the
                          onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the Job, or have a client or user
                          terminate the Job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job Manager
                          creates a set of Tasks but then takes no further role in their execution. The
                          default value is true. If you are using the onAllTasksComplete and
                          onTaskFailure attributes to control Job lifetime, and using the Job Manager
                          Task only to create the Tasks for the Job (not to monitor progress), then it
                          is important to set killJobOnCompletion to false.

                                  or more characters (for example pattern abc* would match abc or
                                  abcdef), ** matches any directory, ? matches any single character,
                                  [abc] matches one character in the brackets, and [a-c] matches one
                                  character in the range. Brackets can include a negation to match any
                                  character not specified (for example [!abc] matches any character but
                                  a, b, or c). If a file name starts with "." it is ignored by default
                                  but may be matched by specifying it explicitly (for example *.gif
                                  will not match .a.gif, but .*.gif will). A simple example: **"" *.txt
                                  matches any file that does not start in '.' and ends with .txt in the
                                  Task working directory or any subdirectory. If the filename contains
                                  a wildcard character it can be escaped using brackets (for example
                                  abc["" *] would match a file named abc*"" ). Note that both and / are
                                  treated as directory separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux.
                                  Environment variables (%var% on Windows or $var on Linux) are
                                  expanded prior to the pattern being applied.

                                  directory, any directory structure already associated with the input
                                  data will be retained in full and appended to the specified filePath
                                  directory. The specified relative path cannot break out of the Task's
                                  working directory (for example by using '..').

                                  points to Azure Blob Storage, it must be readable from compute nodes.
                                  There are three ways to get such a URL for a blob in Azure storage:
                                  include a Shared Access Signature (SAS) granting read permissions on
                                  the blob, use a managed identity with read permission, or set the ACL
                                  for the blob or its container to allow public access.

                                  autoStorageContainerName, storageContainerUrl and httpUrl properties
                                  are mutually exclusive and one of them must be specified. This URL
                                  must be readable and listable from compute nodes. There are three
                                  ways to get such a URL for a container in Azure storage: include a
                                  Shared Access Signature (SAS) granting read and list permissions on
                                  the container, use a managed identity with read and list permissions,

                          Tasks can run simultaneously with the Job Manager on a Compute Node. The Job
                          Manager Task counts normally against the Compute Node's concurrent Task
                          limit, so this is only relevant if the Compute Node allows multiple
                          concurrent Tasks. The default value is true.

                                  example, if the task mutates the registry in a way which could impact
                                  other tasks, or if certificates have been specified on the pool which
                                  should not be accessible by normal tasks but should be accessible by
                                  StartTasks. Known values are: "task", "pool".

                          features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using
                          "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the
                          command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to
                          the Task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable
                          (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).

                              to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the Task once, and may
                              then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is
                              3, Batch tries the Task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If
                              the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the Task
                              after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
                              service retries the Task without limit, however this is not recommended
                              for a start task or any task. The default value is 0 (no retries).

                          with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with error code
                          TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask; if you are calling the REST API directly, the

                                  property is specified, filePath is optional and is the directory to
                                  download the files to. In the case where filePath is used as a
                                  directory, any directory structure already associated with the input
                                  data will be retained in full and appended to the specified filePath
                                  directory. The specified relative path cannot break out of the Task's
                                  working directory (for example by using '..').

                                  points to Azure Blob Storage, it must be readable from compute nodes.
                                  There are three ways to get such a URL for a blob in Azure storage:
                                  include a Shared Access Signature (SAS) granting read permissions on
                                  the blob, use a managed identity with read permission, or set the ACL
                                  for the blob or its container to allow public access.

                                  must be readable and listable from compute nodes. There are three

                          to its maximum retry count (as specified in the constraints element). If the
                          Task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch
                          service will not schedule Tasks of the Job to the Node. The Node remains
                          active and eligible to run Tasks of other Jobs. If false, the Batch service
                          will not wait for the Job Preparation Task to complete. In this case, other
                          Tasks of the Job can start executing on the Compute Node while the Job
                          Preparation Task is still running; and even if the Job Preparation Task
                          fails, new Tasks will continue to be scheduled on the Compute Node. The

                          have the same ID as the Job Release Task. If you try to submit a Task with
                          the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with error code

                          minutes. You may not specify a timeout longer than 15 minutes. If you do, the
                          Batch service rejects it with an error; if you are calling the REST API

                          same region and subscription as the Azure Batch Account. The specified subnet
                          should have enough free IP addresses to accommodate the number of Compute
                          Nodes which will run Tasks from the Job. This can be up to the number of
                          Compute Nodes in the Pool. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal must
                          have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control
                          (RBAC) role for the specified VNet so that Azure Batch service can schedule
                          Tasks on the Nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet
                          has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the
                          Nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service
                          will set the state of the Compute Nodes to unusable. This is of the form
                          /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.
                          If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG), then
                          a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound communication from
                          the Azure Batch service. For Pools created with a Virtual Machine
                          configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and
                          port 3389 for Windows. Port 443 is also required to be open for outbound
                          connections for communications to Azure Storage. For more details see:

                                      network must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure
                                      Batch Account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP
                                      addresses to accommodate the number of Compute Nodes in the Pool.
                                      If the subnet doesn't have enough free IP addresses, the Pool
                                      will partially allocate Nodes and a resize error will occur. The
                                      'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal must have the 'Classic
                                      Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
                                      role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow
                                      communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule
                                      Tasks on the Nodes. This can be verified by checking if the
                                      specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG).
                                      If communication to the Nodes in the specified subnet is denied
                                      by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the state of the
                                      Compute Nodes to unusable. For Pools created with
                                      virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks
                                      ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for
                                      Pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic
                                      virtual networks are supported. If the specified VNet has any
                                      associated Network Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved
                                      system ports must be enabled for inbound communication. For Pools
                                      created with a virtual machine configuration, enable ports 29876
                                      and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for
                                      Windows. For Pools created with a cloud service configuration,
                                      enable ports 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound
                                      connections to Azure Storage on port 443. For more details see:

                                      this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch
                                      tries the Task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If
                                      the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
                                      the Task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service
                                      retries the Task without limit, however this is not recommended
                                      for a start task or any task. The default value is 0 (no
                                      retries).

                          Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
                          retry count is 3, Batch tries a Task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
                          retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
                          Tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the Task
                          without limit, however this is not recommended for a start task or any task.

                                      addresses to accommodate the number of Compute Nodes in the Pool.
                                      If the subnet doesn't have enough free IP addresses, the Pool
                                      will partially allocate Nodes and a resize error will occur. The

                                      Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
                                      role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow
                                      communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule
                                      Tasks on the Nodes. This can be verified by checking if the
                                      specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG).
                                      If communication to the Nodes in the specified subnet is denied
                                      by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the state of the

                                      ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for
                                      Pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic
                                      virtual networks are supported. If the specified VNet has any
                                      associated Network Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved
                                      system ports must be enabled for inbound communication. For Pools
                                      created with a virtual machine configuration, enable ports 29876
                                      and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for
                                      Windows. For Pools created with a cloud service configuration,
                                      enable ports 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound
                                      connections to Azure Storage on port 443. For more details see:

                          specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try each
                          Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
                          retry count is 3, Batch tries a Task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
                          retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
                          Tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the Task
                          without limit, however this is not recommended for a start task or any task.
                          The default value is 0 (no retries).

                          that are still running. In this case, the termination reason will be

                      default value is -1, which means there's no limit to the number of tasks that can
                      be run at once. You can update a job's maxParallelTasks after it has been created

                      because a Job's completion behavior may not be changed from terminatejob to
                      noaction. You may not change the value from terminatejob to noaction - that is,
                      once you have engaged automatic Job termination, you cannot turn it off again. If
                      you try to do this, the request fails and Batch returns status code 400 (Bad
                      Request) and an 'invalid property value' error response. If you do not specify
                      this element in a PUT request, it is equivalent to passing noaction. This is an
                      error if the current value is terminatejob. Known values are: "noaction",

                                      addresses to accommodate the number of Compute Nodes in the Pool.
                                      If the subnet doesn't have enough free IP addresses, the Pool
                                      will partially allocate Nodes and a resize error will occur. The

                                      Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
                                      role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow
                                      communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule
                                      Tasks on the Nodes. This can be verified by checking if the
                                      specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG).
                                      If communication to the Nodes in the specified subnet is denied
                                      by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the state of the

                                      ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for
                                      Pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic
                                      virtual networks are supported. If the specified VNet has any
                                      associated Network Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved
                                      system ports must be enabled for inbound communication. For Pools
                                      created with a virtual machine configuration, enable ports 29876
                                      and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for
                                      Windows. For Pools created with a cloud service configuration,
                                      enable ports 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound
                                      connections to Azure Storage on port 443. For more details see:

        The Batch service supports two ways to control the work done as part of a Job. In the first
        approach, the user specifies a Job Manager Task. The Batch service launches this Task when it
        is ready to start the Job. The Job Manager Task controls all other Tasks that run under this
        Job, by using the Task APIs. In the second approach, the user directly controls the execution
        of Tasks under an active Job, by using the Task APIs. Also note: when naming Jobs, avoid
        including sensitive information such as user names or secret project names. This information
        may appear in telemetry logs accessible to Microsoft Support engineers.

        :param job: The Job to be added.
        :type job: JSON
        :keyword timeout: The maximum time that the server can spend processing the request, in
         seconds. The default is 30 seconds.
        :paramtype timeout: int
        :keyword client_request_id: The caller-generated request identity, in the form of a GUID with
         no decoration such as curly braces, e.g. 9C4D50EE-2D56-4CD3-8152-34347DC9F2B0. Default value is
         None.
        :paramtype client_request_id: str
        :keyword return_client_request_id: Whether the server should return the client-request-id in
         the response. Default value is False.
        :paramtype return_client_request_id: bool
        :keyword ocp_date: The time the request was issued. Client libraries typically set this to the
         current system clock time; set it explicitly if you are calling the REST API directly. Default
         value is None.

                          specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try each
                          Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
                          retry count is 3, Batch tries a Task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
                          retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
                          Tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the Task
                          without limit, however this is not recommended for a start task or any task.
                          The default value is 0 (no retries).

                          are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job Manager Task does not
                          affect the Job status. In this case, you should either use the
                          onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the Job, or have a client or user
                          terminate the Job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job Manager
                          creates a set of Tasks but then takes no further role in their execution. The
                          default value is true. If you are using the onAllTasksComplete and
                          onTaskFailure attributes to control Job lifetime, and using the Job Manager
                          Task only to create the Tasks for the Job (not to monitor progress), then it
                          is important to set killJobOnCompletion to false.

                                  a, b, or c). If a file name starts with "." it is ignored by default
                                  but may be matched by specifying it explicitly (for example *.gif
                                  will not match .a.gif, but .*.gif will). A simple example: **"" *.txt
                                  matches any file that does not start in '.' and ends with .txt in the
                                  Task working directory or any subdirectory. If the filename contains
                                  a wildcard character it can be escaped using brackets (for example
                                  abc["" *] would match a file named abc*"" ). Note that both and / are
                                  treated as directory separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux.
                                  Environment variables (%var% on Windows or $var on Linux) are
                                  expanded prior to the pattern being applied.

                                  points to Azure Blob Storage, it must be readable from compute nodes.
                                  There are three ways to get such a URL for a blob in Azure storage:
                                  include a Shared Access Signature (SAS) granting read permissions on
                                  the blob, use a managed identity with read permission, or set the ACL
                                  for the blob or its container to allow public access.

                                  must be readable and listable from compute nodes. There are three
                                  ways to get such a URL for a container in Azure storage: include a

                                  the container, use a managed identity with read and list permissions,

                          Tasks can run simultaneously with the Job Manager on a Compute Node. The Job
                          Manager Task counts normally against the Compute Node's concurrent Task
                          limit, so this is only relevant if the Compute Node allows multiple
                          concurrent Tasks. The default value is true.

                                  example, if the task mutates the registry in a way which could impact
                                  other tasks, or if certificates have been specified on the pool which
                                  should not be accessible by normal tasks but should be accessible by
                                  StartTasks. Known values are: "task", "pool".

                          features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using
                          "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the
                          command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to
                          the Task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable
                          (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).

                              to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the Task once, and may
                              then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is
                              3, Batch tries the Task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If
                              the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the Task
                              after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
                              service retries the Task without limit, however this is not recommended
                              for a start task or any task. The default value is 0 (no retries).

                          can have the same ID as the Job Preparation Task. If you try to submit a Task
                          with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with error code
                          TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask; if you are calling the REST API directly, the

                                  There are three ways to get such a URL for a blob in Azure storage:
                                  include a Shared Access Signature (SAS) granting read permissions on
                                  the blob, use a managed identity with read permission, or set the ACL
                                  for the blob or its container to allow public access.

                          have the same ID as the Job Release Task. If you try to submit a Task with
                          the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with error code

                          Batch service rejects it with an error; if you are calling the REST API

                          Tasks on the Nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet
                          has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the
                          Nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service
                          will set the state of the Compute Nodes to unusable. This is of the form
                          /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.
                          If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG), then
                          a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound communication from
                          the Azure Batch service. For Pools created with a Virtual Machine
                          configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and
                          port 3389 for Windows. Port 443 is also required to be open for outbound
                          connections for communications to Azure Storage. For more details see:
                          https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration.

                                      If the subnet doesn't have enough free IP addresses, the Pool
                                      will partially allocate Nodes and a resize error will occur. The
                                      'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal must have the 'Classic
                                      Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
                                      role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow
                                      communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule
                                      Tasks on the Nodes. This can be verified by checking if the
                                      specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG).
                                      If communication to the Nodes in the specified subnet is denied
                                      by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the state of the
                                      Compute Nodes to unusable. For Pools created with
                                      virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks
                                      ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for
                                      Pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic
                                      virtual networks are supported. If the specified VNet has any
                                      associated Network Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved
                                      system ports must be enabled for inbound communication. For Pools
                                      created with a virtual machine configuration, enable ports 29876
                                      and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for
                                      Windows. For Pools created with a cloud service configuration,
                                      enable ports 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound
                                      connections to Azure Storage on port 443. For more details see:

                                      this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch
                                      tries the Task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If
                                      the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
                                      the Task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service
                                      retries the Task without limit, however this is not recommended
                                      for a start task or any task. The default value is 0 (no
                                      retries).

                                  will try each Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For
                                  example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a Task up to 4
                                  times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is
                                  0, the Batch service does not retry Tasks. If the maximum retry count
                                  is -1, the Batch service retries the Task without limit, however this
                                  is not recommended for a start task or any task. The default value is
                                  0 (no retries).

                                  terminates it and any Tasks that are still running. In this case, the
                                  termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property
                                  is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the Job may run.

                                  contains the Pool configuration data from when the Job was added or
                                  updated. That poolInfo element may also contain a poolId element. If
                                  it does, the two IDs are the same. If it does not, it means the Job
                                  ran on an auto Pool, and this property contains the ID of that auto
                                  Pool.

                                  - the Job Manager Task completed, and killJobOnCompletion was set to
                                  true. MaxWallClockTimeExpiry - the Job reached its maxWallClockTime
                                  constraint. TerminateJobSchedule - the Job ran as part of a schedule,
                                  and the schedule terminated. AllTasksComplete - the Job's
                                  onAllTasksComplete attribute is set to terminatejob, and all Tasks in
                                  the Job are complete. TaskFailed - the Job's onTaskFailure attribute

                                  take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the
                                  command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or
                                  "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file

                                  directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable

                                      will try the Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For
                                      example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the Task up
                                      to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry

                                  you should either use the onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate
                                  the Job, or have a client or user terminate the Job explicitly. An
                                  example of this is if the Job Manager creates a set of Tasks but then
                                  takes no further role in their execution. The default value is true.
                                  If you are using the onAllTasksComplete and onTaskFailure attributes
                                  to control Job lifetime, and using the Job Manager Task only to
                                  create the Tasks for the Job (not to monitor progress), then it is
                                  important to set killJobOnCompletion to false.

                                          Both relative and absolute paths are supported. Relative
                                          paths are relative to the Task working directory. The
                                          following wildcards are supported: * matches 0 or more
                                          characters (for example pattern abc* would match abc or
                                          abcdef), ** matches any directory, ? matches any single
                                          character, [abc] matches one character in the brackets, and
                                          [a-c] matches one character in the range. Brackets can
                                          include a negation to match any character not specified (for
                                          example [!abc] matches any character but a, b, or c). If a
                                          file name starts with "." it is ignored by default but may be
                                          matched by specifying it explicitly (for example *.gif will
                                          not match .a.gif, but .*.gif will). A simple example: **""
                                          *.txt matches any file that does not start in '.' and ends
                                          with .txt in the Task working directory or any subdirectory.
                                          If the filename contains a wildcard character it can be
                                          escaped using brackets (for example abc["" *] would match a
                                          file named abc*"" ). Note that both and / are treated as
                                          directory separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux.
                                          Environment variables (%var% on Windows or $var on Linux) are

                                  shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to
                                  take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the
                                  command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or
                                  "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file
                                  paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the Task working
                                  directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable
                                  (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).

                                      that this value specifically controls the number of retries for
                                      the Task executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service
                                      will try the Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For
                                      example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the Task up
                                      to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry
                                      count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the Task after the
                                      first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
                                      service retries the Task without limit, however this is not
                                      recommended for a start task or any task. The default value is 0
                                      (no retries).

                                  because the reboot occurred while the Task was running). Therefore,
                                  you should always write a Job Preparation Task to be idempotent and
                                  to behave correctly if run multiple times. The default value is true.

                                  not wait for the Job Preparation Task to complete. In this case,
                                  other Tasks of the Job can start executing on the Compute Node while
                                  the Job Preparation Task is still running; and even if the Job
                                  Preparation Task fails, new Tasks will continue to be scheduled on
                                  the Compute Node. The default value is true.

                                  Job. This can be up to the number of Compute Nodes in the Pool. The
                                  'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal must have the 'Classic
                                  Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role
                                  for the specified VNet so that Azure Batch service can schedule Tasks
                                  on the Nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet
                                  has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to
                                  the Nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch
                                  service will set the state of the Compute Nodes to unusable. This is
                                  of the form
                                  /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.
                                  If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups
                                  (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound
                                  communication from the Azure Batch service. For Pools created with a
                                  Virtual Machine configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well
                                  as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for Windows. Port 443 is also
                                  required to be open for outbound connections for communications to
                                  Azure Storage. For more details see:

                                              the subnet doesn't have enough free IP addresses, the

                                              will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal
                                              must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor'

                                              the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule Tasks on
                                              the Nodes. This can be verified by checking if the
                                              specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups
                                              (NSG). If communication to the Nodes in the specified
                                              subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will
                                              set the state of the Compute Nodes to unusable. For Pools

                                              networks are supported. If the specified VNet has any
                                              associated Network Security Groups (NSG), then a few
                                              reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound
                                              communication. For Pools created with a virtual machine
                                              configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as
                                              port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for Windows. For Pools
                                              created with a cloud service configuration, enable ports

                                          rejects the request with an error; if you are calling the
                                          REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).

                                              Optional. The Batch service retries a Task if its exit
                                              code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically
                                              controls the number of retries. The Batch service will
                                              try the Task once, and may then retry up to this limit.
                                              For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries
                                              the Task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries).
                                              If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does
                                              not retry the Task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the
                                              Batch service retries the Task without limit, however
                                              this is not recommended for a start task or any task. The
                                              default value is 0 (no retries).

                                  it does, the two IDs are the same. If it does not, it means the Job
                                  ran on an auto Pool, and this property contains the ID of that auto
                                  Pool.

                                  true. MaxWallClockTimeExpiry - the Job reached its maxWallClockTime
                                  constraint. TerminateJobSchedule - the Job ran as part of a schedule,
                                  and the schedule terminated. AllTasksComplete - the Job's
                                  onAllTasksComplete attribute is set to terminatejob, and all Tasks in
                                  the Job are complete. TaskFailed - the Job's onTaskFailure attribute
                                  is set to performExitOptionsJobAction, and a Task in the Job failed
                                  with an exit condition that specified a jobAction of terminatejob.

                                  directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable
                                  (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).

                                      that this value specifically controls the number of retries for
                                      the Task executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service
                                      will try the Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For
                                      example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the Task up
                                      to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry
                                      count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the Task after the
                                      first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
                                      service retries the Task without limit, however this is not
                                      recommended for a start task or any task. The default value is 0
                                      (no retries).

                                  when the Job Manager Task completes, the Batch service marks the Job
                                  as complete. If any Tasks are still running at this time (other than
                                  Job Release), those Tasks are terminated. If false, the completion of
                                  the Job Manager Task does not affect the Job status. In this case,
                                  you should either use the onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate
                                  the Job, or have a client or user terminate the Job explicitly. An
                                  example of this is if the Job Manager creates a set of Tasks but then
                                  takes no further role in their execution. The default value is true.
                                  If you are using the onAllTasksComplete and onTaskFailure attributes
                                  to control Job lifetime, and using the Job Manager Task only to
                                  create the Tasks for the Job (not to monitor progress), then it is
                                  important to set killJobOnCompletion to false.

                                          paths are relative to the Task working directory. The
                                          following wildcards are supported: * matches 0 or more
                                          characters (for example pattern abc* would match abc or
                                          abcdef), ** matches any directory, ? matches any single
                                          character, [abc] matches one character in the brackets, and
                                          [a-c] matches one character in the range. Brackets can
                                          include a negation to match any character not specified (for
                                          example [!abc] matches any character but a, b, or c). If a
                                          file name starts with "." it is ignored by default but may be
                                          matched by specifying it explicitly (for example *.gif will
                                          not match .a.gif, but .*.gif will). A simple example: **""
                                          *.txt matches any file that does not start in '.' and ends
                                          with .txt in the Task working directory or any subdirectory.
                                          If the filename contains a wildcard character it can be
                                          escaped using brackets (for example abc["" *] would match a
                                          file named abc*"" ). Note that both and / are treated as
                                          directory separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux.

                                          Node. If this property is not specified for a Linux Compute
                                          Node, then a default value of 0770 is applied to the file.

                                          and describes the path which the file will be downloaded to,
                                          including the filename. Otherwise, if the
                                          autoStorageContainerName or storageContainerUrl property is
                                          specified, filePath is optional and is the directory to
                                          download the files to. In the case where filePath is used as
                                          a directory, any directory structure already associated with
                                          the input data will be retained in full and appended to the
                                          specified filePath directory. The specified relative path
                                          cannot break out of the Task's working directory (for example
                                          by using '..').

                                  Manager on a Compute Node. The Job Manager Task counts normally
                                  against the Compute Node's concurrent Task limit, so this is only

                                  shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to
                                  take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the
                                  command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or
                                  "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file
                                  paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the Task working
                                  directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable
                                  (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).

                                      will try the Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For
                                      example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the Task up
                                      to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry
                                      count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the Task after the
                                      first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
                                      service retries the Task without limit, however this is not
                                      recommended for a start task or any task. The default value is 0
                                      (no retries).

                                  because the reboot occurred while the Task was running). Therefore,
                                  you should always write a Job Preparation Task to be idempotent and
                                  to behave correctly if run multiple times. The default value is true.

                                          and describes the path which the file will be downloaded to,
                                          including the filename. Otherwise, if the

                                          use a managed identity with read permission, or set the ACL
                                          for the blob or its container to allow public access.

                                  the constraints element). If the Task has still not completed

                                  Account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to

                                  Job. This can be up to the number of Compute Nodes in the Pool. The

                                  on the Nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet
                                  has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to
                                  the Nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch
                                  service will set the state of the Compute Nodes to unusable. This is
                                  of the form

                                  If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups
                                  (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound
                                  communication from the Azure Batch service. For Pools created with a
                                  Virtual Machine configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well
                                  as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for Windows. Port 443 is also
                                  required to be open for outbound connections for communications to
                                  Azure Storage. For more details see:

                                          rejects the request with an error; if you are calling the

                                              and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features
                                              such as environment variable expansion. If you want to
                                              take advantage of such features, you should invoke the
                                              shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c

                                              If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a

                                              Optional. The Batch service retries a Task if its exit
                                              code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically
                                              controls the number of retries. The Batch service will
                                              try the Task once, and may then retry up to this limit.
                                              For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries
                                              the Task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries).
                                              If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does
                                              not retry the Task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the
                                              Batch service retries the Task without limit, however
                                              this is not recommended for a start task or any task. The
                                              default value is 0 (no retries).
