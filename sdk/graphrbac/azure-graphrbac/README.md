# Microsoft Azure SDK for Python

This is the Microsoft Azure Graph RBAC Client Library.

`azure-graphrbac` is about Azure AD Graph API, which is now deprecated. We do not support SDK fixes to this product anymore. Please refer to this issue for additional way to get support to move to Microsoft Graph API:
https://github.com/azure-deprecation/dashboard/issues/60

The recommendation is to use MSGraph and its SDK instead to replace it:
