## Breaking changes

- `SearchFieldDataType` now comes from the generated enum set (`_enums.SearchFieldDataType`) rather than the legacy `_edm` helper. What was previously a module full of simple constants such as:

  ```py
  String = "Edm.String"
  Int32 = "Edm.Int32"
  Int64 = "Edm.Int64"
  Single = "Edm.Single"
  Double = "Edm.Double"
  Boolean = "Edm.Boolean"
  DateTimeOffset = "Edm.DateTimeOffset"
  GeographyPoint = "Edm.GeographyPoint"
  ComplexType = "Edm.ComplexType"
  ```

  is now the code-generated, case-insensitive enum:

  ```py
  class SearchFieldDataType(str, Enum, metaclass=CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta):
      STRING = "Edm.String"
      INT32 = "Edm.Int32"
      INT64 = "Edm.Int64"
      DOUBLE = "Edm.Double"
      BOOLEAN = "Edm.Boolean"
      DATE_TIME_OFFSET = "Edm.DateTimeOffset"
      GEOGRAPHY_POINT = "Edm.GeographyPoint"
      COMPLEX = "Edm.ComplexType"
      SINGLE = "Edm.Single"
      HALF = "Edm.Half"
      INT16 = "Edm.Int16"
      S_BYTE = "Edm.SByte"
      BYTE = "Edm.Byte"
  ```

  Typing changes (upper-snake names, enum semantics, added values) are breaking even though runtime behavior matches.

- The public `__all__` exports for the `azure.search.documents` and `azure.search.documents.aio` packages were regenerated to expose only `SearchClient`. Symbols such as `ApiVersion`, `IndexDocumentsBatch`, `SearchIndexingBufferedSender`, `SearchItemPaged`, `AsyncSearchItemPaged`, and `RequestEntityTooLargeError` no longer resolve from these package roots unless `_patch` re-exports them.

- The indexing packages (`azure.search.documents.indexes` and `.indexes.aio`) now expose only `SearchIndexClient` and `SearchIndexerClient`. Helper models previously imported via the package root must now be pulled from `azure.search.documents.indexes.models`.

- Hand-authored helpers like `serialize`, `deserialize`, and `SearchFieldDataType.Collection` disappeared with the regenerated `indexes/models/_models.py`. Any customer code that called those helpers directly will break.

- Version-specific helpers `SentimentSkillVersion` and `EntityRecognitionSkillVersion` were removed; only the v3 skill classes remain. Customers relying on the version enums/types must migrate to the new surface.

- Namespace package headers for `azure/__init__.py` and `azure/search/__init__.py` were replaced with minimal stubs. While behavior is identical, the files no longer include the legacy copyright text or pylint directives; strict consumers expecting those symbols could be affected.

## Additional changes

- All `__init__` modules (sync/async clients and indexes) now follow the standard `_client` + `_patch` pattern: UTF-8 header, MIT notice, `TYPE_CHECKING` guard for `_patch`, curated `__all__`, and `_patch_sdk()` invocation. This brings the package in line with other Track 2 SDKs.

- `MANIFEST.in` now explicitly includes `azure/search/documents/py.typed` near the top, ensuring the type marker ships with the wheel without relying on default ordering.

- Namespace package order was adjusted so `azure/__init__.py` and `azure/search/__init__.py` are included after tests/samples, matching the usual codegen layout and avoiding duplicate include directives.

- The enormous `indexes/models/__init__.py` now re-exports hundreds of classes and enums from autogenerated `_models`/`_enums` modules rather than layering shims on top of `_generated`. This adds new AI Services Vision types (`AIServicesVisionVectorizer`, `AIServicesVisionParameters`, etc.), richer cognitive-services identity models, and the latest knowledge-base entities.

- `_models.py` itself is now generated off the REST model base (`_Model`, `rest_field`, `rest_discriminator`), providing consistent serialization/deserialization for new features like AI Services vectors, vector search profiles, and knowledge bases.

- Minor whitespace/style cleanups were applied to `_search_client.py`, `_search_client_async.py`, and their indexing counterparts (e.g., removing trailing spaces, collapsing method bodies) to comply with formatter expectations.

## Patch targets / follow-ups

- Reintroduce convenience exports (e.g., `SimpleField`, `SearchableField`, `ComplexField`, `RequestEntityTooLargeError`, `SearchFieldDataType.Collection`) via `_patch.py` so existing `from azure.search.documents import ...` statements continue to work.

- Recreate the `serialize` / `deserialize` helpers or document their removal; multiple samples and customers rely on them to convert between REST payloads and SDK models.

- Ensure batching conveniences (`IndexDocumentsBatch.add_*_actions`, `SearchClient.upload_documents/delete_documents/merge_documents/merge_or_upload_documents`, `SearchIndexingBufferedSender`) remain available; consider moving them into `_patch` if the generator omits them.

- Validate and, if needed, patch behaviors that previously diverged from the TSP baseline: `SearchClient` constructor parameter ordering, `autocomplete`/`suggest` return payloads, `get_*` list operations returning raw inner results, delete operations accepting full objects, and `create_or_update` not requiring explicit `name` fields.

- Preserve `get_*_names` helper APIs (`get_indexer_names`, `get_skillset_names`, `get_data_source_connection_names`) if they were part of the public contract; add patches to expose them if codegen removed them.

- Confirm `SearchField` continues to honor the `hidden` flag (instead of `retrievable`) and that continuation tokens, retry logic, and document indexing semantics match the pre-TSP implementation; add targeted patches where behavior regressed.
