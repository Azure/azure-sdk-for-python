# Search Performance Tests

In order to run the performance tests, the `devtools_testutils` package must be installed. This is done as part of the `dev_requirements`.
Start be creating a new virtual environment for your perf tests. This will need to be a Python 3 environment, preferably >=3.7.

### Setup for test resources

These tests will run against a pre-configured search service. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-indexer-tutorial) about how to configure the service and import data. The following environment variable will need to be set for the tests to access the live resources:
```
AZURE_SEARCH_API_KEY=<search api key>
AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=<end point url>
AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME=<index name>
```

### Setup for perf test runs

```cmd
(env) ~/search/azure-search-documents> pip install -r dev_requirements.txt
(env) ~/search/azure-search-documents> pip install -e .
```

## Test commands

When `devtools_testutils` is installed, you will have access to the `perfstress` command line tool, which will scan the current module for runable perf tests. Only a specific test can be run at a time (i.e. there is no "run all" feature).

```cmd
(env) ~/search/azure-search-documents> cd tests
(env) ~/search/azure-search-documents/tests> perfstress
```
Using the `perfstress` command alone will list the available perf tests found. 

### Common perf command line options
These options are available for all perf tests:
- `--duration=10` Number of seconds to run as many operations (the "run" function) as possible. Default is 10.
- `--iterations=1` Number of test iterations to run. Default is 1.
- `--parallel=1` Number of tests to run in parallel. Default is 1.
- `--warm-up=5` Number of seconds to spend warming up the connection before measuring begins. Default is 5.
- `--sync` Whether to run the tests in sync or async. Default is False (async). This flag must be used for Storage legacy tests, which do not support async.
- `--no-cleanup` Whether to keep newly created resources after test run. Default is False (resources will be deleted).
- `--num-documents` The number of results expect to be returned.

## Example command
```cmd
(env) ~/search/azure-search-documents/tests> perfstress SearchDocumentsTest
(env) ~/search/azure-search-documents/tests> perfstress AutoCompleteTest
(env) ~/search/azure-search-documents/tests> perfstress SuggestTest
```
