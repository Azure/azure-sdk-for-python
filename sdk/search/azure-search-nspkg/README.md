# Microsoft Azure SDK for Python

This is the Microsoft Azure Search namespace package. It isn't intended to
be installed directly. Search client libraries are located elsewhere:
- [`azure-search-documents`](https://pypi.org/project/azure-search-documents)

This package is for Python 2 only. It provides the necessary files for other
packages to extend the `azure` namespace. Python 3.x libraries use
[`PEP420`](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420/) instead.
