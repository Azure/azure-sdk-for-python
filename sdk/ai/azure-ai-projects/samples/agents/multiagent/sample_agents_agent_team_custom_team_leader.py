DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates how to multiple agents using AgentTeam with traces.

USAGE:
    python sample_agents_agent_team_custom_team_leader.py

    Before running the sample:

    pip install azure-ai-projects azure-identity

    Set these environment variables with your own values:
    PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING - the Azure AI Project connection string, as found in your AI Foundry project.
    MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME - the name of the model deployment to use.
