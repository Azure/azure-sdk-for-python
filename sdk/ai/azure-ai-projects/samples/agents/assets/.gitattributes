# Force LF line endings for test files to ensure consistent binary representation
# across Windows and Linux platforms.
#
# These files are read and sent as binary REST API request payloads in tests.
# Without consistent line endings, the binary content differs between platforms,
# causing recorded test traffic to be inconsistent and test playback to fail.
#
# By enforcing LF endings, the binary representation remains identical regardless
# of the platform where tests are executed.
