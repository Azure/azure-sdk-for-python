DESCRIPTION:
    Given an AIProjectClient, this sample demonstrates how to enumerate the properties of all connections,
    get the properties of a default connection, and get the properties of a connection by its name.

USAGE:
    python sample_connections.py

    Before running the sample:

    pip install azure-ai-projects azure-identity azure-ai-inference openai

    Set these environment variables with your own values:
    1) PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING - The project connection string, as found in the overview page of your
       Azure AI Foundry project.
    2) CONNECTION_NAME - The name of a connection, as found in the "Connected resources" tab
       in the Management Center of your AI Foundry project.
