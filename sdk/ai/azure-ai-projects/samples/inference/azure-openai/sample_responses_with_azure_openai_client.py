DESCRIPTION:
    Given an AIProjectClient, this sample demonstrates how to get an authenticated
    AzureOpenAI client from the openai package, and perform one `responses` operation.

USAGE:
    python sample_responses_with_azure_openai_client.py

    Before running the sample:

    pip install azure-ai-projects openai

    Set these environment variables with your own values:
    1) PROJECT_ENDPOINT - The Azure AI Project endpoint, as found in the overview page of your
       Azure AI Foundry project. Required.
    2) MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME - The model deployment name, as found in your AI Foundry project. Required.
    3) CONNECTION_NAME - The name of an Azure OpenAI connection, as found in the "Connected resources" tab
       in the Management Center of your AI Foundry project. Required.

    Update the Azure OpenAI api-version as needed (see `api_version=` below). Values can be found here:
    https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/openai/reference#api-specs. Note that `responses` operations
    are only supported in the preview API version at the moment.
