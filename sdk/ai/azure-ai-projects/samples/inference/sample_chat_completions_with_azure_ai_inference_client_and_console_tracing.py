DESCRIPTION:
    Given an AIProjectClient, this sample demonstrates how to get an authenticated 
    ChatCompletionsClient from the azure.ai.inference package. The client
    is already instrumented with console OpenTelemetry tracing.

USAGE:
    python sample_chat_completions_with_azure_ai_inference_client_and_console_tracing.py

    Before running the sample:

    pip install azure-ai-projects azure-ai-inference azure-identity opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http

    Set these environment variables with your own values:
    * PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING - The Azure AI Project connection string, as found in your AI Studio Project.
    * MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME - The model deployment name, as found in your AI Studio Project.
    * AZURE_TRACING_GEN_AI_CONTENT_RECORDING_ENABLED - Optional. Set to `true` to trace the content of chat
      messages, which may contain personal data. False by default.
