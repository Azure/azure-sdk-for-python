DESCRIPTION:
    Given an AIProjectClient, this sample demonstrates how to get an authenticated 
    AsyncAzureOpenAI client from the azure.ai.inference package.

USAGE:
    python sample_get_azure_openai_client_async.py

    Before running the sample:

    pip install azure-ai-projects aiohttp openai

    Set these environment variables with your own values:
    * PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING - the Azure AI Project connection string, as found in your AI Foundry project.
    * MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME - The model deployment name, as found in your AI Foundry project.

    Update the Azure OpenAI api-version as needed (see `api_version=` below). Values can be found here:
    https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/reference#api-specs
