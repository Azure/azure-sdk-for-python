These are the GitHub CoPilot instructions used to edit emitted code, in order to set the
required Foundry-Features HTTP request header in preview operations.

Look at all the Python source files under \azure-sdk-for-python\sdk\ai\azure-ai-projects\azure in this repository.
Find all the public methods that have a required input argument named "foundry_features" (note that some method
will have "foundry_features" as an optional input argument. Ignore those). An example of such a method is one that 
has the following in the method signature: 
foundry_features: Literal[FoundryFeaturesOptInKeys.EVALUATIONS_V1_PREVIEW]
For each of the public methods that have a required input argument named "foundry_features",
remove the input argument from the method signature and the corresponding document strings.
Instead, update the method itself, and set the value of "foundry_features" to the value shown in the
method signature. In the example above, that operation will look like this:
foundry_features = FoundryFeaturesOptInKeys.EVALUATIONS_V1_PREVIEW.
At the end, show a summary report of all the method you edited, and which FoundryFeaturesOptInKeys
value was used for each method.
