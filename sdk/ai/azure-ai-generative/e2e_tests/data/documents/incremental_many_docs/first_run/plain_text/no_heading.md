Memes - What even are they?

According to gpt-35-turbo:

Memes have become an integral part of internet culture in recent years. They are images, videos, or pieces of text that are often humorous and spread rapidly through social media and other online platforms.

The term "meme" was first coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book "The Selfish Gene." He defined it as a cultural unit that spreads from person to person within a society. In the context of the internet, memes can be seen as digital versions of this idea.

Memes come in many different forms. Some are simple images with captions added for humor or commentary. Others involve video clips edited together to create new meanings or jokes. Text-based memes often use bold lettering and unusual fonts to convey their message.

One reason why memes have become so popular is because they allow people to express complex ideas in a simplified way. They also provide a sense of community among those who share similar interests or perspectives.

Despite their widespread popularity, some people still struggle to understand what exactly makes something a meme. The answer is not always clear-cut, but generally speaking, if something has been widely shared on social media and has taken on a life of its own beyond its original context, it could be considered a meme.

In conclusion, memes may seem like just silly pictures and videos on the internet but they represent much more than that - they reflect our collective values and experiences as an online community.
