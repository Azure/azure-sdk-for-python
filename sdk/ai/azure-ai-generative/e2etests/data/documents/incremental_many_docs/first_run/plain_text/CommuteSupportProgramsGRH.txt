Guaranteed Ride Home
Real Estate and Facilities (RE&F) understands that unexpected events may occur during the workday that require a ride home. All Microsoft employees (FTEs) and external staff can use the Guaranteed Ride Home (GRH) program on days that they did not drive alone to work. 

​​​​​​​Limits on the number of trips allowed have been increased. You can now request a Guaranteed Ride Home up to 12 times per fiscal year.

To provide even greater flexibility, you may request a GRH through your preferred ride-hailing service (e.g., Uber or Lyft) or Shuttle Services, although there are important differences in how the ride home is serviced and how it gets paid. Below you will find information about how and when you can request a GRH.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Requesting GRH as an FTE
FTEs will use Uber/Lyft and should submit an expense report following a GRH trip. If you are an FTE, and you request a GRH through a ride-hailing service such as Lyft or Uber, you will be responsible for paying for the ride and claiming it back as an expense to the RE&F Internal Order (1744370). ​​​​​​​

To request a GRH reimbursement:
Submit a new expense report via the MyExpense tool
For "Category" select "Guaranteed ride home"

Enter the transaction date of the trip

For Internal Order enter 1744370 (Leave Cost Center blank)

Enter Merchant used i.e. Uber or Lyft

Enter Transaction amount

Save and close

Be sure your manager (or skip level, whoever has the SAFE approval) is on the final approver line

Submit expense

Please note that you will need to provide a receipt of the GRH if it is more than $75.00, and you must submit the expense within one month of the trip per Microsoft policy.

Manager/Approvers must have SAFE limits set up in order to approve this expense.

Visit MS Authorize to set up that action. Please review the SAFE approver details and process.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Requesting GRH as External Staff

​​​​​​​External Staff can request a ride from Shuttle Services between the hours of 9:00 am and 9:00 pm (Monday-Friday) by calling 425-553-2556. GRH service is not available after hours or weekends. External Staff are not eligible for trip reimbursement from Microsoft and will be responsible for paying for any trips booked through ride-hailing apps, but may seek reimbursement guidance from their company.

To request a GRH via Shuttle Services:
Call Shuttle Service Dispatch at 425-553-2556
Provide information about the GRH (pick-up location, destination, mobile phone number, etc.)
Proceed to the main lobby of the pick-up location​​​​​​​
If you’re an external staff member you can check with your employer to see if you are eligible for trip reimbursement when using a ride hailing app; they may then charge the expense back to Microsoft if allowed based on their own expense policy. Individuals and their managers are responsible for ensuring compliance with the 12 GRH rides per fiscal year limit.

External Staff can request a GRH by calling Shuttle Services at 425-553-2556 between 9:00 am - 9:00 pm. If you need to cancel your GRH, please reach out to Shuttle Services. ​​​​​​​

Important:
To book a Wheelchair Accessible Trip (WAT) outside business hours, contact Yellow Cab at 425-455-4999. Wait times are typically 30-45 minutes, so we recommend calling early.

Individuals and their managers will be responsible for ensuring compliance with the 12 GRH per fiscal year limit.
