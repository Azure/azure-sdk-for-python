Compute instance is a managed cloud-based workstation for data scientists. Each compute instance has only one owner, although you can share files between multiple compute instances.
Compute instances make it easy to get started with machine learning development and provide management and enterprise readiness capabilities for IT administrators.
Use a compute instance as your fully configured and managed development environment in the cloud for machine learning. They can also be used as a compute target for training and inferencing for development and testing purposes.
Note: Items marked (preview) in this article are currently in public preview. For more information, see Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews.

For compute instance Jupyter functionality to work, ensure that web socket communication isn't disabled. Ensure your network allows websocket connections to *.instances.azureml.net and *.instances.azureml.ms.
