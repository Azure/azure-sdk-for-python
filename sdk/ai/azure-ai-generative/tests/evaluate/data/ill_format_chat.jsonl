How did it get there?\r\n\r\nKEY FACTS\r\nBuilt in 1923 at Doncaster Works, costing \u00a37,944\r\nWeight: 97 tonnes\r\nLength: 70ft\r\nOfficially the first locomotive to reach 100mph, and the first to circumnavigate the globe\r\nHolds the world record for a non-stop run in a steam locomotive, set in 1989 with a 422-mile trip\r\nWHERE DID IT ALL BEGIN?\r\nFlying Scotsman was built in Doncaster, the first locomotive of the newly formed London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). It went into service on 24 February 1923 with number 1472. It was designed by Sir Nigel Gresley as part of the A1 class\u2014the most powerful locomotives used by the LNER at that time.\r\n\r\nBy 1924, when it was selected to appear at the British Empire Exhibition in London, the loco had been renumbered 4472\u2014and given the name 'Flying Scotsman' after the daily 10.00 London to Edinburgh rail service which started in 1862.\r\n\r\nFlying Scotsman at the 1924 British Empire ExhibitionScience Museum Group Collection\r\nFlying Scotsman at the 1924 British Empire Exhibition.\r\nScience Museum Group Collection\r\nThe British Empire Exhibition made Flying Scotsman famous, and it went on to feature in many more publicity events for the LNER. In 1928, it was given a new type of tender with a corridor, which meant that a new crew could take over without stopping the train. This allowed it to haul the first ever non-stop London to Edinburgh service on 1 May that year, reducing the journey time to eight hours.\r\n\r\nIn 1934, Scotsman was clocked at 100mph on a special test run\u2014officially the first locomotive in the UK to reach that speed. The test run proved to the LNER's directors that steam power could provide high speeds, negating a plan for the company to use diesel power on its high-speed services.\r\n\r\nIn 1948, British Railways was formed and rail travel in Britain was nationalised. Scotsman, now numbered 60103, was painted blue for a time, then BR Green.\r\n\r\nIt remained this colour until 1963, when it was retired by British Rail. By this time, it had undergone several alterations to improve its performance\u2014but it had been pulling trains for 40 years, and steam engines were becoming old-fashioned.\r\n\r\nWHO OWNS FLYING SCOTSMAN?\r\nIn January 1963, Alan Pegler bought Flying Scotsman. As part of the deal, Pegler negotiated a complete overhaul of the locomotive.\r\n\r\nIt was converted back to single-chimney condition and repainted in LNER livery. The tender was exchanged for a corridor type, and an agreement made that enabled it to run on the main line. In a blaze of publicity, Flying Scotsman ran its last train for British Railways on 14 January 1963.\r\n\r\nIn May 1968 on the 40th anniversary of the first non-stop run, Flying Scotsman travelled non-stop from London King's Cross to Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nIn 1969 Flying Scotsman headed to the United States on a tour intended to promote British exports. The tour broke even in its first year, but the second lost money.\r\n\r\nIn a bid to balance the books, Pegler arranged for the train to travel to San Francisco. The trip worked well operationally but was a financial disaster. Alan Pegler was forced into bankruptcy and Scotsman was stranded in the USA.\r\n\r\nHowever, in 1973 Flying Scotsman was brought back to the UK after William McAlpine heard about the situation in the USA. He promptly put together a rescue plan, paying off the creditors and buying the locomotive.\r\n\r\nMcAlpine had the engine restored at Derby Works and kept it running for 23 years in his ownership, extensively overhauling it twice. He even took Flying Scotsman to Australia, making it the first steam locomotive to circumnavigate the globe on its voyage there and back. While in Australia in 1989 it also set a new record for the longest non-stop run by a steam locomotive at 422 miles.\r\n\r\nFollowing the successful tour of Australia, Flying Scotsman ran special trains around Britain, including regular runs over the famous Settle to Carlisle Railway and trips hauling the prestigious Orient Express Pullman train.\r\n\r\nThe locomotive was repaired again in the early 1990s, at which time pop impresario Pete Waterman formed a short-lived partnership with Sir William to run the locomotive"}, {"title": "Key facts in The history of Flying Scotsman", "content": "In February 1996 businessman Tony Marchington bought Scotsman outright for \u00a31.25 million.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Flying Scotsman hit the headlines again with yet another crisis over its ownership.\r\n\r\nA campaign spearheaded by the National Railway Museum to save the locomotive for the nation amassed the support of thousands, confirming its status as a national treasure. \r\n\r\nThe appeal to keep the steam icon in Britain was supported by a \u00a31.8 million grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the generosity of the public. Its restoration was also completed with the help of a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of \u00a3275,000.\r\n\r\nSCOTSMAN AND THE NATIONAL RAILWAY MUSEUM\r\nFrom 2006, Flying Scotsman underwent an extensive restoration in the workshop of Riley & Son (E) Ltd. In 2016 the painstaking \u00a34.2m project to bring the legend back to life\u2014resplendent in BR Green livery in its guise as 60103\u2014was completed.\r\n\r\nAs the restoration process came to an end, all eyes were once again trained on the world\u2019s most famous locomotive. The next chapter in the Flying Scotsman story was its triumphant return as a working museum exhibit, conquering yet another record as the oldest mainline working locomotive on Britain\u2019s tracks.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly one of the jewels in the crown of our world-class collection, it can now be experienced by a new generation of Scotsman fans and will captivate the public for generations to come"}]}}]}
