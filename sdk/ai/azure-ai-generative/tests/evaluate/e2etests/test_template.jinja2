Relevance measures how well the answer addresses the main aspects of the question, based on the context. Consider whether all and only the important aspects are contained in the answer when evaluating relevance. Given the context and question, score the relevance of the answer between one to five stars using the following rating scale:
One star: the answer completely lacks relevance
Two stars: the answer mostly lacks relevance
Three stars: the answer is partially relevant
Four stars: the answer is mostly relevant
Five stars: the answer has perfect relevance

This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
