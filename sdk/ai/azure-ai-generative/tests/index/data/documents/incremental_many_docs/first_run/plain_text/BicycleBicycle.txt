Getting started
Bicycling is a healthy and environmentally friendly way to commute, and it saves you money. On this page you will find several programs to support your bicycle commute. Unless otherwise noted, these programs are available to all Microsoft employees (FTEs), vendors, and external staff.
​​​​
​​​​​​​​​​​​​​If you are thinking about becoming a bicycle commuter, here are some suggestions to help you ease into bicycle commuting:
​​​

Try a practice run on a weekend to find a good route and see how long it takes.
Take a class from City of Redmond on bike commuting basics. Learn how to ride confidently and safely. 
Find a coworker or friend who bikes to work and commute with them. You can search for bicyclists with a similar commute by running a bicycle ride match at Rideshare Online.
Start by biking to work just one day a week, then work your way up to multiple days a week.
Make it a multimodal commute:
Bicycle to a bus stop or transit facility, then bus the rest of the way.
Take your bicycle on the bus in the morning and then bicycle home.
Drive part of the way (e.g. to a regional bike trail) and then bike the rest of the way.
Bicycle support programs
Below you will find some great programs to support your bicycle commuting as well as information about the location of bicycle cages and racks and shower and locker facilities.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

​​​​​​​​​​​​Bike Cages, lockers, showers and towel service
Microsoft supports commuters who bicycle or run to work by providing lockers, showers, and towel service in locker rooms at many Microsoft buildings. There are also day-use equipment lockers in the secure bicycle parking cages located at specific campus locations. 

Bike cages are located throughout the Redmond Campus, each one near a men's and women's locker room. Each bike cage has: ​​​​​​​

Restricted access (one must have a Microsoft ID badge to access a cage)
Vertical or floor mounted bike racks
Equipment lockers
Enhanced lighting and security cameras
A repair stand with tools and an air pump
To access a cage, hold your Microsoft ID badge to the card reader as you would to enter a Microsoft building. Below are maps showing the specific locations of the bike cages and nearby locker rooms. For a PDF version, click here.


Bicycle commuter reimbursement program
Microsoft employees in the Puget Sound Region who regularly commute to work by bicycle can be reimbursed up to $240 per calendar year for bicycle purchases, bicycle improvements (e.g., parts and components), bicycle maintenance, bicycle safety equipment/clothing, and/or bicycle storage. 

To learn more about this program, please visit the bicycle commuter reimbursement page. 

Bicycle tune-ups
Eastside Ski & Sport (located at The Commons) and Velofix (mobile shop servicing all Puget Sound Microsoft locations) provide Microsoft employees and external staff with a convenient place to have their bicycle tuned up.

​​​​​​​Microsoft employees are eligible for two subsidized tune-ups per year, external staff must pay full price. Details can be found on the bicycle tune-up page. 


​​SR - 520 Bicycle Shuttle
All Microsoft employees (FTEs), vendors, and external staff are welcome to use the SR-520 Bicycle Shuttle as part of their bike commute. ​​​​​​​

The SR-520 trail is also now open all the way across the water, so cyclists can ride between Seattle and the Eastside both on the SR-520 bridge and the I-90 bridge.

Visit the Shuttle tile on MERGE for the SR-520 Bicycle Shuttle schedule.​​​​​

Bicycle competitions and events
Whether you are a seasoned cyclist or a newbie, there are friendly competitions and events each spring and summer to make bicycle commuting even more fun and rewarding. You can qualify to win great prizes in all of these events!

The Bike Everywhere Challenge takes place throughout the month of May. Ride solo or as part of a team for extra fun, friendly competition, and prize drawings.
The Microsoft Bike to Work Day Breakfast is held on the third Friday of each May in the Commons Courtyard by the Sub-Mixer building.

The National Bike Challenge​, which occurs annually from September 1st through September 30th, is a free and friendly competition that encourages participants, as well as their friends, neighbors, and co-workers, to ride more.
