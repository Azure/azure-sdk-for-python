Together, they faced a powerful current that threatened to sweep them away and a group of territorial squids that guarded a magnificent treasure.\n\nAs Finn and Luna overcame each obstacle, their friendship grew stronger, and Finn realized that the true treasure of the Abyss was not the gemstones, but the companionship and the knowledge he gained. With hearts full of gratitude and memories to last a lifetime, Finn and Luna bid farewell to the Abyss and returned to their respective homes, carrying the lessons of their adventure with them.\n\nAnd so, Finn's adventurous spirit and bravery not only led him to uncover the mysteries of the deep but also to form an unexpected friendship that transcended the boundaries of their underwater worlds.\n", "metadata": {"doc_id": "tutorials_README.md7", "chunk_hash": "333900f1e9669be46ba4fcbc3f28d0aabf517d6f41182c741eda3750bd3acba2", "source": {"title": "Azure Machine Learning SDK (v2) end to end tutorials", "filename": "tutorials_README.md", "url": "file:///tutorials_README.md", "mtime": 1683224602.8592987}, "stats": {"tiktokens": 1238, "chars": 3507, "lines": 54}, "markdown_heading": {"heading": "Code of Conduct", "level": 2}}, "document_id": "tutorials_README.md7"}

You can now request a Guaranteed Ride Home up to 12 times per fiscal year.\n\nTo provide even greater flexibility, you may request a GRH through your preferred ride-hailing service (e.g., Uber or Lyft) or Shuttle Services, although there are important differences in how the ride home is serviced and how it gets paid. Below you will find information about how and when you can request a GRH.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nRequesting GRH as an FTE\nFTEs will use Uber/Lyft and should submit an expense report following a GRH trip.

They are images, videos, or pieces of text that are often humorous and spread rapidly through social media and other online platforms.\n\nThe term \"meme\" was first coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book \"The Selfish Gene.\" He defined it as a cultural unit that spreads from person to person within a society. In the context of the internet, memes can be seen as digital versions of this idea.\n\nMemes come in many different forms. Some are simple images with captions added for humor or commentary. Others involve video clips edited together to create new meanings or jokes. Text-based memes often use bold lettering and unusual fonts to convey their message.\n\nOne reason why memes have become so popular is because they allow people to express complex ideas in a simplified way. They also provide a sense of community among those who share similar interests or perspectives.\n\nDespite their widespread popularity, some people still struggle to understand what exactly makes something a meme. The answer is not always clear-cut, but generally speaking, if something has been widely shared on social media and has taken on a life of its own beyond its original context, it could be considered a meme.\n\nIn conclusion, memes may seem like just silly pictures and videos on the internet but they represent much more than that - they reflect our collective values and experiences as an online community.\n", "metadata": {"doc_id": "no_heading.md0", "chunk_hash": "447ae77384c8d03abc677e49a471161087fcb68e1fab3ca74784b27ca0f49fda", "source": {"title": "no_heading.md", "filename": "no_heading.md", "url": "file:///no_heading.md", "mtime": 1683224602.8096333}, "stats": {"tiktokens": 307, "chars": 1558, "lines": 18}, "markdown_heading": {"heading": "no_heading.md", "level": 0}}, "document_id": "no_heading.md0"}
