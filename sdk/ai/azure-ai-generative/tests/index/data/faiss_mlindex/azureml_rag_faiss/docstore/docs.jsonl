All Microsoft employees (FTEs) and external staff can use the Guaranteed Ride Home (GRH) program on days that they did not drive alone to work. \n\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bLimits on the number of trips allowed have been increased. You can now request a Guaranteed Ride Home up to 12 times per fiscal year.\n\nTo provide even greater flexibility, you may request a GRH through your preferred ride-hailing service (e.g., Uber or Lyft) or Shuttle Services, although there are important differences in how the ride home is serviced and how it gets paid. Below you will find information about how and when you can request a GRH.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nRequesting GRH as an FTE\nFTEs will use Uber/Lyft and should submit an expense report following a GRH trip.

GRH service is not available after hours or weekends. External Staff are not eligible for trip reimbursement from Microsoft and will be responsible for paying for any trips booked through ride-hailing apps, but may seek reimbursement guidance from their company.\n\nTo request a GRH via Shuttle Services:\nCall Shuttle Service Dispatch at 425-553-2556\nProvide information about the GRH (pick-up location, destination, mobile phone number, etc.)\nProceed to the main lobby of the pick-up location\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nIf you\u2019re an external staff member you can check with your employer to see if you are eligible for trip reimbursement when using a ride hailing app; they may then charge the expense back to Microsoft if allowed based on their own expense policy.

{"content": "Memes - What even are they?\n\n\nMemes - What even are they?\n\nAccording to gpt-35-turbo:\n\nMemes have become an integral part of internet culture in recent years. They are images, videos, or pieces of text that are often humorous and spread rapidly through social media and other online platforms.\n\nThe term \"meme\" was first coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book \"The Selfish Gene.\" He defined it as a cultural unit that spreads from person to person within a society. In the context of the internet, memes can be seen as digital versions of this idea.\n\nMemes come in many different forms. Some are simple images with captions added for humor or commentary. Others involve video clips edited together to create new meanings or jokes. Text-based memes often use bold lettering and unusual fonts to convey their message.\n\nOne reason why memes have become so popular is because they allow people to express complex ideas in a simplified way. They also provide a sense of community among those who share similar interests or perspectives.\n\nDespite their widespread popularity, some people still struggle to understand what exactly makes something a meme. The answer is not always clear-cut, but generally speaking, if something has been widely shared on social media and has taken on a life of its own beyond its original context, it could be considered a meme.\n\nIn conclusion, memes may seem like just silly pictures and videos on the internet but they represent much more than that - they reflect our collective values and experiences as an online community.\n", "metadata": {"doc_id": "no_heading.md0", "chunk_hash": "447ae77384c8d03abc677e49a471161087fcb68e1fab3ca74784b27ca0f49fda", "source": {"title": "no_heading.md", "filename": "no_heading.md", "url": "file:///no_heading.md", "mtime": 1683224602.8096333}, "stats": {"tiktokens": 314, "chars": 1528, "lines": 15}, "markdown_heading": {"heading": "no_heading.md", "level": 0}}, "document_id": "no_heading.md0"}
