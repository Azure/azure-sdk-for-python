DESCRIPTION:
    Given an AIProjectClient, this sample demonstrates how to use the asynchronous
    `.deployments` methods to enumerate AI models deployed to your AI Foundry Project.

USAGE:
    python sample_deployments_async.py

    Before running the sample:

    pip install azure-ai-projects azure-identity aiohttp

    Set these environment variables with your own values:
    1) PROJECT_ENDPOINT - Required. The Azure AI Project endpoint, as found in the overview page of your
       Azure AI Foundry project.
    2) DEPLOYMENT_NAME - Required. The name of the deployment to retrieve.
    3) MODEL_PUBLISHER - Required. The publisher of the model to filter by.
