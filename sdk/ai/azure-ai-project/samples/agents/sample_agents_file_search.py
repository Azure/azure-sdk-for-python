DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates how to use agent operations with file searching from
    the Azure Agents service using a synchronous client.

USAGE:
    python sample_agents_file_search.py

    Before running the sample:

    pip install azure.ai.project azure-identity

    Set this environment variables with your own values:
    PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING - the Azure AI Project connection string, as found in your AI Studio Project.
