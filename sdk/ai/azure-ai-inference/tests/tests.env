# Environment variables required for running tests.
#
# All values should be empty by default. Fill them in locally before running live tests on your dev box,
# but do not commit these changes to the repository.
#
# To run tests you need an AI Foundry project with the following three AI models deployed:
# - One non-OpenAI chat completion model that supports function call tools. We use `Mistral-Large-2411`.
# - One OpenAI chat completion model that supports image input. We use `gpt-4o`.
# - One non-OpenAI text embedding model. We use `Cohere-embed-v3-english`.
# 
# To find the values below:
# - Open the "Management center" in your AI Foundry project.
# - Click on "Models + endpoints" tab
# - Click on the relevant model deployment 
# - For non OpenAI models:
#     - The _ENDPOINT value can be found under the "Endpoint" box, under "Target URI". Copy it as-is.
#     - The _KEY value can be found under the "Endpoint" box, under "Key"
# - For OpenAI models:
#     - The _ENDPOINT value can be found under the "Endpoint" box, under "Target URI", but you need 
#       to remove the trailing `/chat/completions?api-version=YYYY-MM-DD-preview`.
#     - The _API_VERSION value is the one found at the end of the "Target URI", and has the from
#       YYYY-MM-DD-preview or YYYY-MM-DD.
#     - The _KEY value can be found under the "Endpoint" box, under "Key"
