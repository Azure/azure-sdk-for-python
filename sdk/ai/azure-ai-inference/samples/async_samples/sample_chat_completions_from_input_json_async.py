DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates how to get a chat completions response from
    the service using an asynchronous client, and directly providing the 
    JSON request body (containing input chat messages).

USAGE:
    python sample_chat_completions_from_input_json_async.py

    Set these two environment variables before running the sample:
    1) AZURE_AI_CHAT_ENDPOINT - Your endpoint URL, in the form 
        https://<your-deployment-name>.<your-azure-region>.inference.ai.azure.com
        where `your-deployment-name` is your unique AI Model deployment name, and
        `your-azure-region` is the Azure region where your model is deployed.
    2) AZURE_AI_CHAT_KEY - Your model key (a 32-character string). Keep it secret.
