# Disclaimer

Starting azure 3.0.0, we don't provide anymore a ChangeLog for the bundle package. Please refer to the ChangeLog
of each individual package.

## 2017-05-16 azure 2.0.0

**Disclaimer**

Starting with this release, we fixed several packaging issues to improve our package generation system:

- Uninstalling of packages using "pip uninstall" now works properly (#1150)
- setuptools install of "azure" works properly (#728)

Update from 2.0.0rc6 *might* work, but we strongly suggest creating a fresh virtual environment.

**Features**

***CLI configuration***

You can now execute your SDK script using the configuration of the [AzureCLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli)

Example::

     from azure.common.client_factory import get_client_from_cli_profile
     from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient
     client = get_client_from_cli_profile(ComputeManagementClient)
     client.virtual_machines.get('rg', 'vm')

Configuration from the CLI is:

- [az login](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli): access to credentials
- [az account set --subscriptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/manage-azure-subscriptions-azure-cli): access to subscription_id
- [az cloud set --name](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/cloud#set): access to base_url (sovereign cloud, Government, Germany, etc.)

Note: CLI and SDK are versioned separately. We do recommend using two different virtual environments. Information will be shared
automatically since the CLI saves it in the $HOME folder. You do need the `azure-cli-core` package in your SDK environment to use this feature.

***Multiple API Version support***

To help support of sovereign cloud (i.e. AzureStack, Azure Government, Azure Germany, Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet - China), the following packages
now officially support several API versions in the same package:

-  [azure-mgmt-resource v1.1.x](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-mgmt-resource/1.1.0)
-  [azure-mgmt-compute v1.0.x](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-mgmt-compute/1.0.0)
-  [azure-mgmt-network v1.0.x](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-mgmt-network/1.0.0)
-  [azure-mgmt-storage v1.0.x](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-mgmt-storage/1.0.0)

Please refer to the PyPI page of these packages for supported ApiVersion.

- azure-mgmt-redis 1.0.0: official stable release (same content than 0.30.0RC5)

**Meta-package**

The 2.0.0rc6 is a release candidate. However, the core packages, from code quality/completeness perspectives can at this time
be considered "stable" - it will be officially labeled as such in September (in sync with other languages).
We are not planning on any further major changes until then.

The azure 2.0.0rc6 package contains the following Azure packages:

- The following packages are still labeled "preview" but can be considered "stable":

  - azure-mgmt-resource 0.30.0rc6
  - azure-mgmt-compute 0.30.0rc6
  - azure-mgmt-network 0.30.0rc6
  - azure-mgmt-storage 0.30.0rc6

The following packages are also available as preview only, not ready for production,
and will NOT be installed with the 2.0.0rc6 "azure" meta-package. We removed then from the 2.0.0rc6
to prepare our customers to the 2.0.0 stable release that will only contains the stable packages
listed before.

## 2016-08-01 azure-servicemanagement-legacy 0.20.4

**Bugfix**

* Incomplete parsing if XML contains namespace #257 #707

**New**

* Associate/Dissociate Reserved IP #695 #716

Thank you to brandondahler, schaefi for their contributions.

## 2016-06-28 Service Bus 0.20.2

**Bugfix**

* New header in Rest API which breaks the SDK #658 #657

## 2016-06-23 Version 2.0.0rc5 / 0.30.0rc5

**Disclaimer**

* There is some breaking changes in the Storage client, due to the update the latest API-Version.
  There is a storage sample with the new version available here:
  https://github.com/Azure-Samples/storage-python-manage
* There is some breaking changes in the GraphRbac client, due to the update the latest API-Version.
  This is an example of change on our tests:
  https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/commit/b03cae526d9ac46d1b477840f15d3729aa0d939f#diff-296e794143f66af83d1bf2db6eb7a935

**Bugfixes**

* Each package has now a correct `__version__` attribute which contains the package version.
* Fixed serialization of continuation tokens containing '.' (batch libraries)

**New**

* New PowerBI Embeddeded preview client
* New Cognitive Services preview client

## 2016-05-24 Version 2.0.0rc4 / 0.30.0rc4

**Disclaimer**

* There is a breaking change in all Client __init__ methods. Configuration classes have disappeared.
  Update this::

    resource_client = ResourceManagementClient(
        ResourceManagementClientConfiguration(
            credentials,
            subscription_id
        )
    )

  to this::

    resource_client = ResourceManagementClient(
        credentials,
        subscription_id
    )

  If you were using the Configuration class, it is still available using the `config` attribute after Client creation::

    resource_client.config.long_running_operation_timeout = 5

**New**

* you can now simplify your call by passing a dict directly and not an instance. This removes the needs to import each model::

    from azure.mgmt.resource.resources.models import ResourceGroup

    resource_client.resource_groups.create_or_update(
        group_name,
        ResourceGroup(
            location='westus',
        )
    )

  can now be written directly::

    resource_client.resource_groups.create_or_update(
        group_name,
        {
            'location':'westus',
        }
    )

* All Resources clients have now alias in the azure.mgmt.resource namespace::

    azure.mgmt.resource.FeatureClient
    azure.mgmt.resource.ManagementLockClient
    azure.mgmt.resource.PolicyClient
    azure.mgmt.resource.ResourceManagementClient
    azure.mgmt.resource.SubscriptionClient

* Enum refactoring. There are now two kinds of enum: "strict" and "soft".

  A "soft" enum can be substituted by any random string without risking a client-side exception. This is useful for
  services which might add new enum types frequently (e.g. VirtualMachine size). The server might decide to refuse our string and
  you might receive a CloudError exception.

  A "strict" enum must follow one of the authorized enum values. Strings are still accepted, but if your value is not valid
  you will receive a SerializationError *without* a call to the REST API. Before, the call was made to the REST API and you received
  a `CloudError` if the server refused the request.

* Latest Swagger update for Redis (API-version 2016-04-01)
* Latest Swagger update for GraphRbac (API-version 1.6)
* Latest Swagger update for CDN (API-version 2016-04-02)
* New Resource Policy client
* New Compute Container client
* New azure-mgmt-commerce preview package for Billing API

**Dependencies**

* msrest must be >= 0.4.0 (see their ChangeLog for details)
* msrestazure must be >= 0.4.0 (see their ChangeLog for details)

  * [Check the ChangeLog on storage github account for details](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-python/releases).


## 2016-04-26 Version 2.0.0rc3 / 0.30.0rc3

**Disclaimer**
There is no known breaking changes between 2.0.0RC2 and 2.0.0RC3.
However, we removed several useless parameters for __init__ methods on model classes. If you get an error message like this after migrating to RC3::

    TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'type'

or::

    TypeError: __init__() takes exactly 1 positional argument (2 given)

You can remove the involved parameter safely, as it should not have been there in the first place.

## 2015-05-13 Version 0.11.0

**IMPORTANT CHANGE THAT AFFECTS STORAGE**

The API for creating shared access signatures has changed. The new API enables
easy production AND consumption of SAS for blob, queue and table storage.

 * To produce a SAS, use generate_shared_access_signature on
   BlobService/QueueService/TableService
 * To consume a SAS, init BlobService/QueueService/TableService with
   account_name & sas_token (no account_key)
 * For blob storage, you can now pass a sas_token to make_blob_url
 * For blob storage, you can now consume public containers/blobs, init
   BlobService/QueueService/TableService with account_name only
   (no account_key or sas_token)

 See http://azure-sdk-for-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/storage.html for
 more details on using SAS with Azure Storage.

**Other changes**

 * Create/list/delete job functionality added to SchedulerManagementService
 * update_site added to WebsiteManagementService to start/stop web sites
 * Target x-ms-version 2014-10-01 for service management
 * Add virtual IP fields in Deployment

## 2015-04-28 Version 0.10.2

**Bugfixes**

   #338 Version 0.10.0 fails with 'SocketReader' object has no attribute 'tell'

## 2015-03-13 Version 0.10.0

**IMPORTANT CHANGE THAT AFFECTS STORAGE USERS (BLOB, QUEUE, TABLE)**

The library now targets x-ms-version '2014-02-14' of the storage REST API.
Previous version of the library targeted '2012-02-12'.

The upgrade to this new version causes some breaking changes for Python SDK users:

* Metrics for blob, queue, table service properties, which used to be accessed
  with the 'metrics' field are now accessed via 'hour_metrics' and 'minute_metrics'.
  Note that a backwards compatible 'metrics' property was added to redirect access
  to 'hour_metrics'.
* Url is no longer returned from list_containers, list_blobs, list_queues.
  For blob, you can use the utility function make_blob_url as an alternate
  way to get a URL.

See MSDN documentation for details on REST API changes:

* in '2013-08-15': https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn592124.aspx
* in '2014-02-14': https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dd894041.aspx


The other changes in this release are:

* Performance improvements in xml deserialization of storage and service bus
  Table storage query_entities is ~25X faster for the maximum of 1000 entities
* Ability to upload and download blobs using multiple connections, along with
  retries when a chunk upload/download failure occurs
  Controlled via the max_connections, max_retries, retry_wait parameters
* Use get_certificate_from_publish_settings to get a .pem certificate from
  your azure publish settings file
* Ability to adjust the global http timeout
* Service bus event hub support (create/update/delete hubs + send events)
* Documentation for API Reference is now available at
  http://azure-sdk-for-python.readthedocs.org/en/documentation/index.html

**Bugfixes**

* #237 Ability to use multiple connections to upload blob chunks in parallel
* #254 Improve performance of table storage (and more?)
* #258 Support authenticating with azureProfile like in CLI tools
* #259 Unicode error is raised instead of actual error
* #263 Change description name
* #268 delete_deployment does not pass comp=media to delete disks
* #271 Update current_name so that multiple parameters with the same name...
* #270 Documentation for capture_vm_image is incorrect
* #273 Unicode error with utf-8 encoding value
* #276 Service Mgmt - Reserved IP create/delete are async
* #280 add support for setting IdleTimeoutInMinutes on load balanced endpoint
* #288 InvalidHeaderValue on BlobService example
* #294 Upload of large files is too slow
* #304 Unable to upload large size files to Azure Page Blob

## 2014-11-21 Version 0.9.0

**IMPORTANT CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR THAT AFFECTS TABLE STORAGE USERS**

The library now converts any datetime object in an entity to UTC before writing
the value to Azure, and it sets the timezone (tzinfo) to UTC on the entities
it reads from Azure. On a related note, python-dateutil is now an external
dependency.

The other changes in this release are:

* Ability to pass in to management APIs a Session object from the requests
  library (or any compatible). This allows more flexibility for authentication,
  including oauth.
* New service management APIs

  - list_role_sizes
  - list_subscriptions (oauth only)
  - rebuild_role_instance
  - delete_role_instances
  - create_reserved_ip_address
  - delete_reserved_ip_address
  - get_reserved_ip_address
  - list_reserved_ip_addresses
  - add_dns_server
  - update_dns_server
  - delete_dns_server
  - list_resource_extensions
  - list_resource_extension_versions
  - capture_vm_image
  - delete_vm_image
  - list_vm_images
  - create_vm_image
  - update_vm_image
* Enhanced service management APIs

  - create_virtual_machine_deployment / add_role

    - custom data
    - additional windows unattend content
    - create from a vm image
    - public ips
    - resource extensions
    - create from remote os image
    - provision guest agent
    - dns servers
    - reserved ip

  - update_role

    - resource extensions
    - provision guest agent

  - create_storage_service

    - account_type replaces geo_replication_enabled (preserved for backwards compat)

* Preliminary Scheduler management API
* Add metrics to Service Bus management API
* Delete Blob - support for x-ms-delete-snapshots header

**Bugfixes**

* #221 Topic names containing slash
* #234 AttributeError on Timestamp property
* #212 Storage: Timstamp's microseconds value out of range
