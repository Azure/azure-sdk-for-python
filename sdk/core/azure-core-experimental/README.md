# Azure Core Experimental client library for Python

If its dependant package introduces breaking changes, the features maybe break. It is not recommended to use azure core experimental library in production environment.

## Getting started

Install the azure core experimental package with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```bash
pip install azure-core-experimental
```
