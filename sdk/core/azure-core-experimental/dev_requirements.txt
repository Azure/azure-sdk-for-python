# this is an experimental package and as such has some experimental dependencies
# those dependencies come with some constraints that we need to work around here
# httpx==0.23.3 and js==1.0 cannot be pulled into a non-CFS azdo feed due to a azdo specific limitation.
# Simultaneously updating either of these dependencies requires a test update. pinning in place for now.
