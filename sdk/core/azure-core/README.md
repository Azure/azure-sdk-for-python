# Azure Core Library

Azure core library defines basic exceptions and shared modules those are needed when you use client libraries. 

As an end user, you don't need to manually install azure-core because it will be installed automatically when you install other SDKs. 

If you are a client library developer, please reference [client library developer reference](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md) for more information.

## Azure Core Library Exceptions

### AzureError
AzureError is the base exception for all errors.
```python
class AzureError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message, *args, **kwargs):
        self.inner_exception = kwargs.get('error')
        self.exc_type, self.exc_value, self.exc_traceback = sys.exc_info()
        self.exc_type = self.exc_type.__name__ if self.exc_type else type(self.inner_exception)
        self.exc_msg = "{}, {}: {}".format(message, self.exc_type, self.exc_value)  # type: ignore
        self.message = str(message)
        super(AzureError, self).__init__(self.message, *args)
```

*message* is any message (str) to be associated with the exception. 

*args* are any additional args to be included with exception.

*kwargs* are keyword arguments to include with the exception. Use the keyword *error* to pass in an internal exception.

**The following exceptions inherit from AzureError:**

### ServiceRequestError
An error occurred while attempt to make a request to the service. No request was sent.

### ServiceResponseError
The request was sent, but the client failed to understand the response.
The connection may have timed out. These errors can be retried for idempotent or safe operations.

### HttpResponseError
A request was made, and a non-success status code was received from the service.
```python
class HttpResponseError(AzureError):
    def __init__(self, message=None, response=None, **kwargs):
        self.reason = None
        self.response = response
        if response:
            self.reason = response.reason
        message = "Operation returned an invalid status code '{}'".format(self.reason)
        try:
            try:
                if self.error.error.code or self.error.error.message:
                    message = "({}) {}".format(
                        self.error.error.code,
                        self.error.error.message)
            except AttributeError:
                if self.error.message: #pylint: disable=no-member
                    message = self.error.message #pylint: disable=no-member
        except AttributeError:
            pass
        super(HttpResponseError, self).__init__(message=message, **kwargs)
```
*message* is the HTTP response error message (optional)

*response* is the HTTP response (optional).

*kwargs* are keyword arguments to include with the exception.

**The following exceptions inherit from HttpResponseError:**

### DecodeError
An error raised during response deserialization.

### ResourceExistsError
An error response with status code 4xx. This will not be raised directly by the Azure core pipeline.

### ResourceNotFoundError
An error response, typically triggered by a 412 response (for update) or 404 (for get/post).

### ClientAuthenticationError
An error response with status code 4xx. This will not be raised directly by the Azure core pipeline.

### ResourceModifiedError
An error response with status code 4xx, typically 412 Conflict. This will not be raised directly by the Azure core pipeline.

### ResourceNotModifiedError
An error response with status code 304. This will not be raised directly by the Azure core pipeline.

### TooManyRedirectsError
An error raised when the maximum number of redirect attempts is reached. The maximum amount of redirects can be configured in the RedirectPolicy.
```python
class TooManyRedirectsError(HttpResponseError):
    def __init__(self, history, *args, **kwargs):
        self.history = history
        message = "Reached maximum redirect attempts."
        super(TooManyRedirectsError, self).__init__(message, *args, **kwargs)
```

*history* is used to document the requests/responses that resulted in redirected requests.

*args* are any additional args to be included with exception.

*kwargs* are keyword arguments to include with the exception.

## Shared modules

### MatchConditions
MatchConditions is an enum to describe match conditions.
```python
class MatchConditions(Enum):
    Unconditionally = 1
    IfNotModified = 2
    IfModified = 3
    IfPresent = 4
    IfMissing = 5
```
