## 1.20.0 (2021-11-04)

### Features Added

- GA `send_request` onto the `azure.core.PipelineClient` and `azure.core.AsyncPipelineClient`. This method takes in
requests and sends them through our pipelines.
- GA `azure.core.rest`. `azure.core.rest` is our new public simple HTTP library in `azure.core` that users will use to create requests, and consume responses.
- GA errors `StreamConsumedError`, `StreamClosedError`, and `ResponseNotReadError` to `azure.core.exceptions`. These errors
are thrown if you mishandle streamed responses from the `azure.core.rest` module

### Breaking Changes

- SansIOHTTPPolicy.on_exception returns None instead of bool.

### Bugs Fixed

- The `Content-Length` header in a http response is strictly checked against the actual number of bytes in the body,
  rather than silently truncating data in case the underlying tcp connection is closed prematurely.
  (thanks to @jochen-ott-by for the contribution)   #20412
- UnboundLocalError when SansIOHTTPPolicy handles an exception    #15222

### Other Changes

- Refactor AzureJSONEncoder (thanks to @Codejune for the contribution)  #21028

## 1.19.0 (2021-09-30)

### Breaking Changes in the Provisional `azure.core.rest` package

- `azure.core.rest.HttpResponse` and `azure.core.rest.AsyncHttpResponse` are now abstract base classes. They should not be initialized directly, instead
your transport responses should inherit from them and implement them.
- The properties of the `azure.core.rest` responses are now all read-only

- HttpLoggingPolicy integrates logs into one record #19925

## 1.18.0 (2021-09-02)

### Features Added

- `azure.core.serialization.AzureJSONEncoder` (introduced in 1.17.0) serializes `datetime.datetime` objects in ISO 8601 format, conforming to RFC 3339's specification.    #20190
- We now use `azure.core.serialization.AzureJSONEncoder` to serialize `json` input to `azure.core.rest.HttpRequest`.

### Breaking Changes in the Provisional `azure.core.rest` package

- The `text` property on `azure.core.rest.HttpResponse` and `azure.core.rest.AsyncHttpResponse` has changed to a method, which also takes
an `encoding` parameter.
- Removed `iter_text` and `iter_lines` from `azure.core.rest.HttpResponse` and `azure.core.rest.AsyncHttpResponse`

### Bugs Fixed

- The behaviour of the headers returned in `azure.core.rest` responses now aligns across sync and async. Items can now be checked case-insensitively and without raising an error for format.

## 1.17.0 (2021-08-05)

### Features Added

- Cut hard dependency on requests library
- Added a `from_json` method which now accepts storage QueueMessage, eventhub's EventData or ServiceBusMessage or simply json bytes to return a `CloudEvent`

### Fixed

- Not override "x-ms-client-request-id" if it already exists in the header.    #17757

### Breaking Changes in the Provisional `azure.core.rest` package

- `azure.core.rest` will not try to guess the `charset` anymore if it was impossible to extract it from `HttpResponse` analysis. This removes our dependency on `charset`.

## 1.16.0 (2021-07-01)

### Features Added

- Add new ***provisional*** methods `send_request` onto the `azure.core.PipelineClient` and `azure.core.AsyncPipelineClient`. This method takes in
requests and sends them through our pipelines.
- Add new ***provisional*** module `azure.core.rest`. `azure.core.rest` is our new public simple HTTP library in `azure.core` that users will use to create requests, and consume responses.
- Add new ***provisional*** errors `StreamConsumedError`, `StreamClosedError`, and `ResponseNotReadError` to `azure.core.exceptions`. These errors
are thrown if you mishandle streamed responses from the provisional `azure.core.rest` module

### Fixed
