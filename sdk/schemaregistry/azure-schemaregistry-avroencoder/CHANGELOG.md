# Release History

## 1.0.0b3 (2022-04-05)

### Breaking Changes

- `auto_register_schemas` keyword in the sync and async `AvroEncoder` constructors has been renamed `auto_register`.

- The `exceptions` module in `azure.schemaregistry.encoder.avroencoder` has been removed.
- The `encode` method on the sync and async `AvroEncoder` only allows subtypes of the `MessageType` protocol as values to the `message_type` optional parameter, rather than any callable that has the method signature `(content: bytes, content_type: str, **kwargs: Any)`.
- The number of hits/misses, in addition to number of entries, for the schema/schema ID caches will be logged at an info level when a new entry is added.

### Other Changes

- This release and future releases will not have backward compatibility support for decoding data that was encoded with the AvroSerializer.
- The `encode` and `decode` methods on `AvroEncoder` support the following message models:

### Features Added

- `request_options` has been added to `encode` and `decode` on `AvroEncoder` as an optional parameter to be passed into client requests.

- `data` in `MessageContent` has been renamed `content`.
- The `data` parameter in `encode` and `decode` on the sync and async `AvroEncoder` has been renamed `content`.
- The `from_message_data` method in the `MessageType` protocol has been renamed `from_message_content`. The `data` parameter in `from_message_content` has been renamed `content`.
