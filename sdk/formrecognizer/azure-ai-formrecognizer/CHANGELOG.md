This functionality is only available for models trained with labels
- Added property `selection_marks` to `FormPage` which contains a list of `FormSelectionMark`
- When passing `include_field_elements=True`, the property `field_elements` on `FieldData` and `FormTableCell` will
also be populated with any selection marks found on the page

numbers to analyze

**Dependency updates**

- Package now requires [azure-common](https://pypi.org/project/azure-common/) version 1.1

## 3.0.0 (2020-08-20)

First stable release of the azure-ai-formrecognizer client library.

**New features**

- Client-level, keyword argument `api_version` can be used to specify the service API version to use. Currently only v2.0
is supported. See the enum `FormRecognizerApiVersion` for supported API versions.
- `FormWord` and `FormLine` now have attribute `kind` which specifies the kind of element it is, e.g. "word" or "line"

## 3.0.0b1 (2020-08-11)

The version of this package now targets the service's v2.0 API.

**Breaking Changes**

- Client library version bumped to `3.0.0b1`
- Values are now capitalized for enums `FormContentType`, `LengthUnit`, `TrainingStatus`, and `CustomFormModelStatus`
- `document_name` renamed to `name` on `TrainingDocumentInfo`
- Keyword argument `include_sub_folders` renamed to `include_subfolders` on `begin_training` methods

**New features**

- `FormField` now has attribute `value_type` which contains the semantic data type of the field value. The options for
`value_type` are described in the enum `FieldValueType`

**Fixes and improvements**

- Fixes a bug where error code and message weren't being returned on `HttpResponseError` if operation failed during polling

Version (1.0.0b1) is the first preview of our efforts to create a user-friendly and Pythonic client library for Azure Form Recognizer.
This library replaces the package found here: https://pypi.org/project/azure-cognitiveservices-formrecognizer/

**Breaking changes: New API design**

- New namespace/package name:
  - The namespace/package name for the Form Recognizer client library has changed from
    `azure.cognitiveservices.formrecognizer` to `azure.ai.formrecognizer`
- Two client design:
    - FormRecognizerClient to analyze fields/values on custom forms, receipts, and form content/layout
    - FormTrainingClient to train custom models (with/without labels), and manage the custom models on your account
- Different analyze methods based on input type: file stream or URL.
    - URL input should use the method with suffix `from_url`
    - Stream methods will automatically detect content-type of the input file
- Asynchronous APIs added under `azure.ai.formrecognizer.aio` namespace
- Authentication with API key supported using `AzureKeyCredential("<api_key>")` from `azure.core.credentials`
- New underlying REST pipeline implementation based on the azure-core library
- Client and pipeline configuration is now available via keyword arguments at both the client level, and per-operation.
    See README for a link to optional configuration arguments
- New error hierarchy:
    - All service errors will now use the base type: `azure.core.exceptions.HttpResponseError`
