FILE: sample_get_operations_async.py

DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates how to list/get all document model operations (succeeded, in-progress, failed)
    associated with the Form Recognizer resource. Kinds of operations returned are "documentModelBuild",
    "documentModelCompose", and "documentModelCopyTo". Note that operation information only persists for
    24 hours. If the operation was successful, the document model can be accessed using get_model or list_models APIs.

USAGE:
    python sample_get_operations_async.py

    Set the environment variables with your own values before running the sample:
    1) AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_ENDPOINT - the endpoint to your Cognitive Services resource.
    2) AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_KEY - your Form Recognizer API key
