FILE: sample_differentiate_custom_forms_with_labeled_and_unlabeled_models_async.py

DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates the differences in output that arise when recognize_custom_forms
    is called with custom models trained with labeled and unlabeled data.
USAGE:
    python sample_differentiate_custom_forms_with_labeled_and_unlabeled_models_async.py

    Set the environment variables with your own values before running the sample:
    1) AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_ENDPOINT - the endpoint to your Cognitive Services resource.
    2) AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_KEY - your Form Recognizer subscription key
    3) CUSTOM_TRAINED_LABELED_MODEL_ID - the ID of your custom model trained with labeled data
    4) CUSTOM_TRAINED_UNLABELED_MODEL_ID - the ID of your custom model trained with unlabeled data
