FILE: sample_train_labelled_model_async.py

DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates how to train a model with labelled data.
USAGE:
    python sample_train_labelled_model_async.py

    Set the environment variables with your own values before running the sample:
    1) AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_ENDPOINT - the endpoint to your Cognitive Services resource.
    2) AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_KEY - your Form Recognizer subscription key
    3) BLOB_SAS_URL - The shared access signature (SAS) Url of your Azure Blob Storage container with your labelled data.
                      See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/form-recognizer/quickstarts/label-tool#connect-to-the-sample-labeling-tool
                      for more detailed descriptions on how to get it.
