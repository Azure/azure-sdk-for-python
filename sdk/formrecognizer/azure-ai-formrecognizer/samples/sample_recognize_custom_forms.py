FILE: sample_recognize_custom_forms.py

DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates how to analyze a form from a document with a custom
    trained model. The form must be of the same type as the forms the custom model
    was trained on. To learn how to train your own models, look at
    sample_train_unlabeled_model.py and sample_train_labeled_model.py
USAGE:
    python sample_recognize_custom_forms.py

    Set the environment variables with your own values before running the sample:
    1) AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_ENDPOINT - the endpoint to your Cognitive Services resource.
    2) AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_KEY - your Form Recognizer API key
    3) CUSTOM_TRAINED_MODEL_ID - the ID of your custom trained model
