FILE: sample_recognize_custom_forms.py

DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates how to analyze a form from a document with a custom
    trained model. To learn how to train your own models, look at
    sample_train_unlabelled_model.py and sample_train_labelled_model.py
USAGE:
    python sample_recognize_custom_forms.py

    Set the environment variables with your own values before running the sample:
    1) AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_ENDPOINT - the endpoint to your Cognitive Services resource.
    2) AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_KEY - your Form Recognizer subscription key
    3) CUSTOM_TRAINED_MODEL_ID - the ID of your custom trained model
