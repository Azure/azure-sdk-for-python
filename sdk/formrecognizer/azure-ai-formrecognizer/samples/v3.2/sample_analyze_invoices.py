DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates how to analyze invoices.

    See fields found on a invoice here:
    https://aka.ms/azsdk/formrecognizer/invoicefieldschema

USAGE:
    python sample_analyze_invoices.py

    Set the environment variables with your own values before running the sample:
    1) AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_ENDPOINT - the endpoint to your Form Recognizer resource.
    2) AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_KEY - your Form Recognizer API key
