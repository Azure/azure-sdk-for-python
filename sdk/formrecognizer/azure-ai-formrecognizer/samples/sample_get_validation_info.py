FILE: sample_get_validation_info_from_recognize_custom_forms.py

DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates how to output the information that will help with manually
    validating your output from recognize custom forms.
USAGE:
    python sample_get_validation_info_from_recognize_custom_forms.py

    Set the environment variables with your own values before running the sample:
    1) AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_ENDPOINT - the endpoint to your Cognitive Services resource.
    2) AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_KEY - your Form Recognizer subscription key
    3) CUSTOM_TRAINED_MODEL_ID - the ID of your custom trained model
