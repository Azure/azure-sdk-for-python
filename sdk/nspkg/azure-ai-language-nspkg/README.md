# Microsoft Azure SDK for Python

This is the Microsoft Azure ai-language Services namespace package.

This package is not intended to be installed directly by the end user.

Since version 3.0, this is Python 2 package only, Python 3.x SDKs will use `PEP420 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420/>` as namespace package strategy.
To avoid issues with package servers that does not support `python_requires`, a Python 3 package is installed but is empty.

It provides the necessary files for other packages to extend the azure.ai namespace.

If you are looking to install the Azure client libraries, see the
`azure <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure>`__ bundle package.
