**General Breaking Changes**

This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might*
introduce breaking changes. In summary, some modules were incorrectly
visible/importable and have been renamed. This fixed several issues
caused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be used in the
first place.

  - CostManagementClient cannot be imported from
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.cost_management_client` anymore (import from
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement` works like before)
  - CostManagementClientConfiguration import has been moved from
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.cost_management_client` to `azure.mgmt.costmanagement`
  - A model `MyClass` from a "models" sub-module cannot be imported
    anymore using `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.models.my_class` (import from
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.models` works like before)
  - An operation class `MyClassOperations` from an `operations`
    sub-module cannot be imported anymore using
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.operations.my_class_operations` (import from
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.operations` works like before)

Last but not least, HTTP connection pooling is now enabled by default.
You should always use a client as a context manager, or call close(), or
use no more than one client per process.
