# Simple example of how to:
# - create a DigitalTwins Service Client using the DigitalTwinsClient constructor
# - list all incoming relationships using the paginated API
#
# Preconditions:
# - Environment variables have to be set
# - DigitalTwins enabled device must exist on the ADT hub

    # DefaultAzureCredential supports different authentication mechanisms and determines
    # the appropriate credential type based of the environment it is executing in.
    # It attempts to use multiple credential types in an order until it finds a working credential.

    url = os.getenv("AZURE_URL")

    # - AZURE_TENANT_ID: The tenant ID in Azure Active Directory
    # - AZURE_CLIENT_ID: The application (client) ID registered in the AAD tenant
    # - AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET: The client secret for the registered application
