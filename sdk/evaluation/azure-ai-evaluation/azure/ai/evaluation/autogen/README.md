# Azure AI Evaluation Client Library for Python Autogenerated Code Generation

## References

- [How to generate client libraries](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/generate-client-libraries/00howtogen/)

# Getting Started

## Typespec setup

- Install the typespec [compiler](https://typespec.io/docs/) by following the "Install tsp" section. You should be able to run `tsp` in your terminal once this is done.

## Raiclient

TODO: Have someone who did more than blindly stumble their way to a solution double check this, especially the step about modifying the tspconfig.

[Source](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/gaugup/AddTypeSpecRAISvc/specification/ai/Azure.AI.Projects/RAISvc) Note, currently not on main. Use main once committed.

- Navigate to `azure-rest-api-specs/specification/ai/Azure.AI.Projects/RAISvc` and make sure you're in the right repo branch.
- The contents of `./tspconfig.yaml` are set to emit autorest files. Temporarily replace the file with the following:
```yaml
emit:
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-python"
options:
  "@azure-tools/typespec-python":
    package-name: "rai_client"
    output-dir: "./rai_client"
```
- Run from  run ` tsp compile main.tsp`
- Check the output. Autogenerated files should be in `tsp-output/@azure-tools/typespec-python/raiclient/`
- Replace the contents of `azure-sdk-for-python/sdk/evaluation/azure-ai-evaluation/azure/ai/evaluation/autogen/raiclient` with the newly generated code.
- Cleanup lingering files and revert the config changed.
