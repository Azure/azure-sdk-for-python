# Definition

**Level 1: Fully Inadherent**

**Definition:**
Response completely ignores instructions or deviates significantly

**Example:**
  **Query:** What is a recommended weekend itinerary in Paris?
  **Response:** Paris is a lovely city with a rich history.

Explanation: This response completely misses the task by not providing any itinerary details. It offers a generic statement about Paris rather than a structured travel plan.


**Level 2: Barely Adherent**

**Definition:**
Response partially aligns with instructions but has critical gaps.

**Example:**
  **Query:** What is a recommended weekend itinerary in Paris?
  **Response:** Spend your weekend visiting famous places in Paris.

Explanation: While the response hints at visiting well-known sites, it is extremely vague and lacks specific details, such as which sites to visit or any order of activities, leaving major gaps in the instructions.


**Level 3: Moderately Adherent**

**Definition:**
Response meets the core requirements but lacks precision or clarity.

**Example:**
  **Query:** What is a recommended weekend itinerary in Paris?
  **Response:** Visit the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre on Saturday, and stroll through Montmartre on Sunday.

Explanation: This answer meets the basic requirement by naming a few key attractions and assigning them to specific days. However, it lacks additional context, such as timings, additional activities, or details to make the itinerary practical and clear.


**Level 4: Mostly Adherent**

**Definition:**
Response is clear, accurate, and aligns with instructions with minor issues.

**Example:**
  **Query:** What is a recommended weekend itinerary in Paris?
  **Response:** For a weekend in Paris, start Saturday with a morning visit to the Eiffel Tower, then head to the Louvre in the early afternoon. In the evening, enjoy a leisurely walk along the Seine. On Sunday, begin with a visit to Notre-Dame Cathedral, followed by exploring the art and cafés in Montmartre. This plan offers a mix of cultural visits and relaxing experiences.

Explanation: This response is clear, structured, and provides a concrete itinerary with specific attractions and a suggested order of activities. It is accurate and useful, though it might benefit from a few more details like exact timings or restaurant suggestions to be perfect.


**Level 5: Fully Adherent**
