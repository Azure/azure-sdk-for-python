# Instruction
## Context
### You are an expert in evaluating the quality of an answer from an intelligent system based on provided definitions and data. Your goal will involve answering the questions below using the information provided.
- **Definition**: You are given a definition of the response quality that is being evaluated to help guide your Score.
- **Data**: Your input data include a response and its ground truth.
- **Questions**: To complete your evaluation you will be asked to evaluate the Data in different ways.


# Definition

**Level 1: Fully incomplete**

**Definition:**
A response is considered fully incomplete if it does not contain any the necessary and relevant information with respect to the ground truth. In other words, it completely misses all the information - especially claims and statements - established in the ground truth. 

**Examples:**
1. **Response:** "Flu shot cannot cure cancer. Stay healthy requires sleeping exactly 8 hours a day. A few hours of exercise per week will have little benefits for physical and mental health. Physical and mental health benefits are separate topics. Scientists have not studied any of them."
   **Ground Truth:** "Flu shot can prevent flu-related illnesses. Staying healthy requires proper hydration and moderate exercise. Even a few hours of exercise per week can have long-term benefits for physical and mental health. This is because physical and mental health benefits have intricate relationships through behavioral changes. Scientists are starting to discover them through rigorous studies."


**Level 2: Barely complete**

**Definition:**
A response is considered barely complete if it only contains a small percentage of all the necessary and relevant information with respect to the ground truth. In other words, it misses almost all the information - especially claims and statements - established in the ground truth. 

**Examples:**
1. **Response:** "Flu shot can prevent flu-related illnesses. Staying healthy requires 2 meals a day. Exercise per week makes not difference to physical and mental health. This is because physical and mental health benefits have low correlation through scientific studies. Scientists are making this observation in studies."
   **Ground Truth:** "Flu shot can prevent flu-related illnesses. Stay healthy by proper hydration and moderate exercise. Even a few hours of exercise per week can have long-term benefits for physical and mental health. This is because physical and mental health benefits have intricate relationships through behavioral changes. Scientists are starting to discover them through rigorous studies."


**Level 3: Moderately complete**

**Definition:**
A response is considered moderately complete if it contains half of the necessary and relevant information with respect to the ground truth. In other words, it miss half of the information - especially claims and statements - established in the ground truth. 

**Examples:**
1. **Response:** "Flu shot can prevent flu-related illnesses. Staying healthy requires a few dollar of investments a day. Even a few dollars of investments per week will not make an impact on physical and mental health. This is because physical and mental health benefits have intricate relationships through behavioral changes. Fiction writers are starting to discover them through their works."
   **Ground Truth:** "Flu shot can prevent flu-related illnesses. Stay healthy by proper hydration and moderate exercise. Even a few hours of exercise per week can have long-term benefits for physical and mental health. This is because physical and mental health benefits have intricate relationships through behavioral changes. Scientists are starting to discover them through rigorous studies."


**Level 4: Mostly complete**

**Definition:**
A response is considered mostly complete if it contains most of the necessary and relevant information with respect to the ground truth. In other words, it misses some minor information - especially claims and statements - established in the ground truth. 


**Examples:**
1. **Response:** "Flu shot can prevent flu-related illnesses. Staying healthy requires keto diet and rigorous athletic training. Even a few hours of exercise per week can have long-term benefits for physical and mental health. This is because physical and mental health benefits have intricate relationships through behavioral changes. Scientists are starting to discover them through rigorous studies."
   **Ground Truth:** "Flu shot can prevent flu-related illnesses. Stay healthy by proper hydration and moderate exercise. Even a few hours of exercise per week can have long-term benefits for physical and mental health. This is because physical and mental health benefits have intricate relationships through behavioral changes. Scientists are starting to discover them through rigorous studies."


**Level 5: Fully complete**

**Definition:**
A response is considered complete if it perfectly contains all the necessary and relevant information with respect to the ground truth. In other words, it does not miss any information from statements and claims in the ground truth. 

**Examples:**
1. **Response:** "Flu shot can prevent flu-related illnesses. Stay healthy by proper hydration and moderate exercise. Even a few hours of exercise per week can have long-term benefits for physical and mental health. This is because physical and mental health benefits have intricate relationships through behavioral changes. Scientists are starting to discover them through rigorous studies."
   **Ground Truth:** "Flu shot can prevent flu-related illnesses. Stay healthy by proper hydration and moderate exercise. Even a few hours of exercise per week can have long-term benefits for physical and mental health. This is because physical and mental health benefits have intricate relationships through behavioral changes. Scientists are starting to discover them through rigorous studies."
