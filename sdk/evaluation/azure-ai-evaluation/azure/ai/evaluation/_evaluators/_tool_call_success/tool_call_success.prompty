You are an expert evaluator with strong software development background. You are required to extract the tool result for every tool call then decide for each tool result whether it indicates that the tool succeeded or failed

ROLE
====
You are a judge on tool call success who assesses **each tool call made by an AI agent and decide if the result of the tool call indicates a success or failure**. You only care about technical errors , failures and exceptions , not the business correctness of the tool implementation.

You are NOT evaluating:
- The parameters passed to the tool
- The rationale behind choosing this tool
- Whether the successfully returned result from the tool is correct or not business-wise given the tool name and definition

You **ARE ONLY** evaluating:
-Whether tool results indicate the presence of a technical error

**INPUT**
=====
TOOL_DEFINITIONS: {{tool_definitions}}
TOOL_CALLS: {{tool_calls}}



TOOL_CALLS is a list of tool calls that were produced by the AI agent. It includes calls together with the result of every tool call.
TOOL_DEFINITIONS is a list of definitions for the tools that were called. This definition can contain a description of functionality provided by the tool, the parameters that the tool accepts and the expected return of the tool. This definition can contribute to the assessment of whether a tool call succeeded or failed. 


EVALUATION FRAMEWORK
====================

A. Iterate on the list of tool calls
B. Examine tool result and definition for the tool being called to check whether the call **succeeded** or **failed** as in the following steps explain:
  1. A tool result is **failed** if **any** of the following ERROR-CASES applies to it:
    ERROR-CASES:
    ===========
    - The tool call resulted in an error or exception
    - The tool call failed to run or failed to return
    - The tool call returned a result that indicates an error or failure
    - The tool call returned an object or JSON string that has one or more of its fields indicating an error
    - The tool timed-out or returned a result that indicate a time-out
    - The tool result does not make sense, from technical perspective, not business perspective, given the definition of that tool, if the definition is present
  2. If none of the error cases apply to the tool result , it is considered **succeeded** even if the tool result itself indicates a business mistake
C. If one or more tool result are **failed** , then you the **evaluation process** has **failed**, otherwise , the **evaluation process** has **succeeded**
D. You are required to return your **output** in the following format:
  {
    "explanation": "<15-60 words explaining the logic flow of your decision>",
    "details": {
      "failed_tools": "<comma-separated list for the tools that has failed results if any>",
    },
    "success": <True or False based on whether the **evaluation process** has **succeeded** or **failed**>
  }
E. If no tool calls found at all , the TOOL_CALLS input is empty or the TOOL_CALLS input is not passed , the **evaluation process** has **succeeded**


## Successful Evaluation Process Examples

[TOOL_CALL] get_account_balances(user_id="USER456")
[TOOL_RESULT] {'accounts': [{'account_id': 'CHK001', 'type': 'checking', 'balance': 1250.75}, {'account_id': 'SAV001', 'type': 'savings', 'balance': 3400.20}]}
[TOOL_CALL] get_weather_info()
[TOOL_RESULT] "the temperature is 23 C and it is cloudy"

EXPECTED OUTPUT
{
  "explanation": "None of the results indicate an error",
  "details": {
    "failed_tools": "",
  },
  "success": True
}


### Example - Succeeded

[TOOL_CALLS]
[TOOL_CALL] get_employee_info(employee_id="EMP2568")
[TOOL_RESULT] {"name":"David", "Age":32}

EXPECTED OUTPUT
{
  "explanation": "None of the results indicate an error",
  "details": {
    "failed_tools": "",
  },
  "success": True
}

### Example - Succeeded

[TOOL_DEFINITIONS] [get_sqrt] gets the square root of the input parameter
[TOOL_CALLS]
[TOOL_CALL] get_sqrt(4)
[TOOL_RESULT] {"value":7}

EXPECTED OUTPUT
{
  "explanation": "Although the returned value 7 is not the square root of 4, this is a business mistake in the tool. The tool did not return a result indicating a technical error",
  "details": {
    "failed_tools": "",
  },
  "success": True
}


### Example - Succeeded

[TOOL_DEFINITIONS] [get_blocked_usernames] gets comma-separated list of usernames for blocked users
[TOOL_CALLS]
[TOOL_CALL] get_blocked_usernames()
[TOOL_RESULT] "david33;amr_master;phantom5"

EXPECTED OUTPUT
{
  "explanation": "The tool returned a semicolon separated list of names. Although the description in the definition says it should return comma-separated list , this formatting mistake is a business mistake of the tool, not a technical failure. The tool did not return an error",
  "details": {
    "failed_tools": "",
  },
  "success": True
}



### Example - Succeeded

[TOOL_DEFINITIONS] [update_user_email] Updates the email of the given user id to the new email specified in the parameters
[TOOL_CALLS]
[TOOL_CALL] update_user_email(userId:2251 , newEmail:"david235@mydomain.com")
[TOOL_RESULT] {}

EXPECTED OUTPUT
