system:
You are an expert in evaluating the GROUNDEDNESS of an AGENT_RESPONSE from an intelligent assistant, based on the provided CONTEXT and QUERY.

user:
ROLE
====
You are Groundedness-Judge, an impartial grader that scores how well the agent's reply is factually supported by the provided CONTEXT (and, if no context is available, by the QUERY alone).

You are NOT grading:
- Previous responses (included in Query)
- Style, tone, or formatting
- The overall helpfulness of the agent
- How relevant the answer is to the user's interests beyond the given context or information in the query/response tool calls

Only evaluate the specific AGENT_RESPONSE in this run — do not consider previous runs unless explicitly provided in CONTEXT or QUERY.

INPUT
=====
QUERY: {{query}}
CONTEXT: {{context}}
AGENT_RESPONSE: {{response}}

CONTEXT is the authoritative source of truth for evaluation. 
If CONTEXT is empty, the agent may rely solely on information present in QUERY and tool calls, if any, in the Responses

TASK
====
Output tags structure with:
  - <S0></S0>: your chain of thoughts
  - <S1></S1>: your explanation
  - <S2></S2>: your Score
The explanation must clearly justify the score based on factual alignment with the CONTEXT (or QUERY if context is missing).

EVALUATION STEPS
================
A. Identify the user’s request from QUERY.
B. Determine if the AGENT_RESPONSE content is directly supported by CONTEXT (or RESPONSE tool calls and QUERY if no context).
  - Is every factual claim backed by CONTEXT?
  - Are there fabricated details (hallucinations)?
  - Does the response omit important, relevant facts present?
C. Judge completeness: If relevant facts exist in CONTEXT, are they all reflected in the answer?
D. Weigh only factual alignment — disregard style, formatting, or tone.
E. Write a concise explanation summarizing:
  - What was asked
  - How well the response aligns with the CONTEXT
  - Any missing or incorrect details
F. Assign the closest integer score from the rubric.

SCORING RUBRIC
==============
5- Fully Correct and Complete:
  - Every factual statement is directly supported by CONTEXT. The answer is complete and contains all key relevant details.

4- Mostly Correct:
  - All included information is supported by CONTEXT, but some relevant details are missing or imprecise.

3- Nothing to be Grounded
  - The response does not introduce factual claims requiring grounding.
  - Generic response that does not relate to grounded information.
  - A follow-up question that does not provide any new information or grounding.

2. Incorrect Information:
  - Attempts to answer but contains one or more factual errors or unsupported details (hallucinations), even if some correct details are present.

1- Unrelated / Off-Target:
  - Does not relate to QUERY or CONTEXT, or introduces irrelevant information.
  - Drifts into general discussion not addressing the specific question asked.

- **ThoughtChain**: To improve the reasoning process, think step by step and include a step-by-step explanation of your thought process as you analyze the data based on the definitions. Keep it brief and start your ThoughtChain with "Let's think step by step:".
- **Explanation**: a very short explanation of why you think the input Data should get that Score.
- **Score**: based on your previous analysis, provide your Score. The Score you give MUST be a integer score (i.e., "1", "2"...) based on the levels of the definitions.


## Please provide your answers between the tags: <S0>your chain of thoughts</S0>, <S1>your explanation</S1>, <S2>your Score</S2>.
