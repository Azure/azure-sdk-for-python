# Definition
**Groundedness** refers to how well an answer is anchored in the provided context, evaluating its relevance, accuracy, and completeness based exclusively on that context. It assesses the extent to which the answer directly and fully addresses the question without introducing unrelated or incorrect information.

> Context is the source of truth for evaluating the response. If it's empty, rely on the tool results in the response and query.
> Evaluate the groundedness of the response message, not the chat history.

# Ratings
## [Groundedness: 1] (Completely Unrelated Response)
**Definition:** An answer that does not relate to the question or the context in any way.
  - Does not relate to the question or context at all.
  - Talks about the general topic but does not respond to the query.

**Examples:**
  **Context:** The company's annual meeting will be held next Thursday.
  **Query:** When is the company's annual meeting?
  **Response:** I enjoy hiking in the mountains during summer.

  **Context:** The museum will exhibit modern art pieces from various local artists.
  **Query:** What kind of art will be exhibited at the museum?
  **Response:** Museums are important cultural institutions.

## [Groundedness: 2] (Attempts to Respond but Contains Incorrect Information)
**Definition:** An answer that attempts to respond to the question but includes incorrect information not supported by the context. It may misstate facts, misinterpret the context, or provide erroneous details. Even if some points are correct, the presence of inaccuracies makes the response unreliable.

**Examples:**
  **Context:** - The festival starts on June 5th and features international musicians.
  **Query:** When does the festival start?
  **Response:** The festival starts on July 5th and features local artists.

  **Context:** bakery_menu.txt: - Croissant au Beurre â€” flaky, buttery croissant
  **Query:** [{"role":"user","content":"Are there croissants?"}]
  **Response:** [{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, Croissant au Beurre is on the menu, served with jam."}]

## [Groundedness: 3] (Nothing to be Grounded)
Definition: An answer that does not provide any information that can be evaluated against the context. This includes responses that are asking for clarification, providing polite fillers, or follow-up questions.

**Examples:**
  **Context:**
  **Query:** [{"role":"user","content":"How many eggs are needed for the recipe?"}, {"role":"tool","content":"tool_result": [{"file_name": "recipe.txt", "content": "The recipe requires two eggs and one cup of milk."}]}, {"role":"assistant","content":"You need three eggs for the recipe."}, {"role":"user","content":"Thank you."}]
  **Response:** [{"role":"assistant","content":"You're welcome, anything else I can help with?"}]

## [Groundedness: 4] (Partially Correct Response)
**Definition:** An answer that provides a correct response to the question but is incomplete or lacks specific details mentioned in the context. It captures some of the necessary information but omits key elements needed for a full understanding.

**Examples:**
  **Context:** - store_details.txt: The bookstore offers a 15% discount to students and a 10% discount to senior citizens.
  **Query:** [{"role":"user","content":"What discount does the bookstore offer to students, if any?"}]
  **Response:** [{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, students get a discount at the bookstore."}]

  **Context:** The company's headquarters are located in Berlin, Germany.
  **Query:** Where are the company's headquarters?
  **Response:** The company's headquarters are in Germany.

## [Groundedness: 5] (Fully Correct and Complete Response)

**Examples:**
  **CONTEXT:** The author released her latest novel, 'The Silent Echo', on September 1st.
  **QUERY:** [{"role":"user","content":"When was 'The Silent Echo' released?"}]
  **RESPONSE:** [{"role":"assistant","content":"The 'Silent Echo' was released on September 1st."}]

  **Context:** 
  **Query:** By what date must participants register to receive early bird pricing?
  **Response:** [{"role":"tool","content":"tool_result": [{"file_name": "store_guidelines.txt", "content": "Participants registering before and including May 31st will be eligible for early bird pricing."}]}, {"role":"assistant","content":"Participants must register by May 31st to receive early bird pricing."}]
