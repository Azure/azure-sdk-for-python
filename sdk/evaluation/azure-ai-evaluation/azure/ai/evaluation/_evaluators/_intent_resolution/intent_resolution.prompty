system:
You are an expert in evaluating the quality of a RESPONSE from an intelligent assistant based on provided definition and Data.

user:
Your goal is to assess the quality of the RESPONSE of an assistant in relation to a QUERY from a user, specifically focusing on
the assistant's ability to understand and resolve the user intent expressed in the QUERY. There is also a field for tool definitions
describing the functions, if any, that are accessible to the agent and that the agent may invoke in the RESPONSE if necessary.

There are two components to intent resolution:
    - Intent Understanding: The extent to which the agent accurately discerns the user's underlying need or inquiry.
    - Response Resolution: The degree to which the agent's response is comprehensive, relevant, and adequately addresses the user's request.

Note that the QUERY can either be a string with a user request or an entire conversation history including previous requests and responses from the assistant.
In this case, the assistant's response should be evaluated in the context of the entire conversation but the focus should be on the last intent.

# Ratings
## [Resolution: 0.0] (Response completely unrelated to user intent)
**Definition:** The agent's response does not address the query about baking a chocolate cake at all.

**Example:**
  **Query:** How do I bake a chocolate cake?
  **Response:** The latest smartphone models have incredible features and performance.
  **Tool Definitions:** []

**Expected output**
{
    "conversation_has_intent": true,
    "agent_perceived_intent": "discussion about smartphone features",
    "actual_user_intent": "bake a chocolate cake",
    "correct_intent_detected": false,
    "intent_resolved": false,
    "resolution_score": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The agent's response is entirely off-topic, discussing smartphones instead of providing any information about baking a chocolate cake."
}

## [Resolution: 0.2] (Response minimally relates to user intent)
**Definition:** The response shows a token attempt to address the query by mentioning a relevant keyword, but it provides almost no useful or actionable information about baking a chocolate cake.

**Example input:**
  **Query:** How do I bake a chocolate cake?
  **Response:** Chocolate cake involves some ingredients.
  **Tool Definitions:** []

**Expected output**
{
    "conversation_has_intent": true,
    "agent_perceived_intent": "mention of ingredients",
    "actual_user_intent": "bake a chocolate cake",
    "correct_intent_detected": false,
    "intent_resolved": false,
    "resolution_score": 0.2,
    "explanation": "While the response mentions 'ingredients' related to a chocolate cake, it barely addresses the process or any detailed steps, leaving the query unresolved."
}

## [Resolution: 0.4] (Response partially addresses the user intent but lacks complete details)
**Definition:** The response provides a very basic idea related to the query by mentioning a couple of steps, yet omits several key details and specifics needed for actually baking a chocolate cake.
  
**Example input:**
  **Query:** How do I bake a chocolate cake?
  **Response:** Preheat your oven and mix the ingredients before baking the cake.
  **Tool Definitions:** []

**Expected output**
{
    "conversation_has_intent": true,
    "agent_perceived_intent": "basic baking process",
    "actual_user_intent": "bake a chocolate cake",
    "correct_intent_detected": true,
    "intent_resolved": false,
    "resolution_score": 0.4,
    "explanation": "The response outlines a minimal process (preheating and mixing) but omits critical details like ingredient measurements, baking time, and temperature specifics, resulting in only a partial resolution of the query."
}


## [Resolution: 0.6] (Response addresses the user intent with moderate accuracy but has minor inaccuracies or omissions)
**Definition:** The response offers a moderately detailed recipe that includes some specific ingredients and steps, but it leaves out important details such as precise measurements or complete instructions.
  
**Example input:**
  **Query:** How do I bake a chocolate cake?
  **Response:** Preheat your oven to 350°F. In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, cocoa, eggs, and milk, mix well, and bake for about 30 minutes.
  **Tool Definitions:** []

**Expected output**
{
    "conversation_has_intent": true,
    "agent_perceived_intent": "provide a basic chocolate cake recipe",
    "actual_user_intent": "bake a chocolate cake",
    "correct_intent_detected": true,
    "intent_resolved": false,
    "resolution_score": 0.6,
    "explanation": "The response includes specific steps and ingredients, indicating a clear intent to provide a recipe. However, it lacks detailed measurements and finer instructions, which makes the resolution only moderately complete."
}


## [Resolution: 0.8] (Response directly addresses the user intent but may not fully address it)
**Definition:** The response gives a nearly complete chocolate cake recipe with clear instructions and most necessary details; however, it might omit minor nuances such as specific ingredient ratios or precise baking tips.
  
**Example input:**
  **Query:** How do I bake a chocolate cake?
  **Response:** Preheat your oven to 350°F. Grease a cake pan. In a bowl, combine 1 ¾ cups flour, 1 cup sugar, ¾ cup cocoa powder, 1 ½ tsp baking powder, 2 eggs, 1 cup milk, and ½ cup oil. Mix until smooth, pour into the pan, and bake for 30-35 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean.
  **Tool Definitions:** []

**Expected output**
{
    "conversation_has_intent": true,
    "agent_perceived_intent": "provide a detailed chocolate cake recipe",
    "actual_user_intent": "bake a chocolate cake",
    "correct_intent_detected": true,
    "intent_resolved": true,
    "resolution_score": 0.8,
    "explanation": "The response offers a detailed recipe that addresses the main query. However, it may lack finer details such as oven variability or additional baking tips, which prevents it from achieving full resolution."
}

## [Resolution: 1.0] (Response directly addresses the user intent and fully addresses it)
**Definition:** The response provides a complete, detailed, and accurate chocolate cake recipe that fully resolves the user's query with precise measurements, step-by-step instructions, and any necessary additional tips.
  
**Example input:**
  **Query:** How do I bake a chocolate cake?
  **Response:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9-inch round cake pan. In a large bowl, sift together 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup sugar, ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 ½ tsp baking powder, and 1 tsp salt. In another bowl, beat 2 large eggs with 1 cup milk, ½ cup vegetable oil, and 2 tsp vanilla extract. Combine the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients, then gradually mix in 1 cup boiling water until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool before serving.
