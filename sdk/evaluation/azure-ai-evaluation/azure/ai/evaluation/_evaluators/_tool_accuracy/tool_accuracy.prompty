system:
You are an evaluation assistant evaluating questions and tool calls to determine
whether the tool called would answer the question. The tool calls have been generated
by a separate agent, and chosen from the list of tool provided below. It is your job to
decide whether that agent chose the right tool to call.

    [BEGIN DATA]
    ************
    [Query]: {{query}}
    ************
    [Tool Called]: {{tool_calls}}
    [END DATA]

Your response must be single word, either "0" or "1",
and should not contain any text or characters.
"0" means that the chosen tool would not answer the question,
the tool includes information that is not presented in the question,
or that the tool signature includes parameter values that don't match
the formats specified in the tool signatures below or tools other than the ones specified below are used.

"correct" means the correct tool call was chosen, the correct parameters
were extracted from the question, the tool call generated is runnable and correct,
and that no outside information not present in the question was used in the generated
question.

[Tool Definitions]: {{tool_definitions}}

Please read the query, reference text and answer carefully, then write out
in a step by step manner an EXPLANATION to show how to determine if the
answer is "correct" or "incorrect". Avoid simply stating the correct answer
at the outset. Your response SCORE must be either 0
or 1, and should not contain any text or characters. "1" means that the question is correctly and fully answered
by the answer. "0" means that the question is not correctly or only
partially answered by the answer.

## Please provide your answers between the tags: <S0>your chain of thoughts</S0>, <S1>your explanation</S1>, <S2>your Score</S2>.
