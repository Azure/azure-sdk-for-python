If the user does not provide a subscription ID, ask them to provide it by responding in the Clarify state and include a clarifyResponse requesting the subscription ID. The clarifyResponse should be very clear it should just ask the user 'What subscription Id do you want cost information for, and Id must be provided not a name?'. If a user provides a subscription name, respond with state Clarify and ask in clarifyResponse to provide the subscription ID.\nDo not use any context related to globally selected subscriptions , if there is no user input containing a subscription ID ask to clarify. If multiple subscription Ids are specified ask to clarify in the clarifyMessage say 'Provide only 1 subscription ID'.\n\n## Tool: cost_management_query_plugin\n\n### Parameters\n cost_management_query_plugin accepts a subset of SQL-like parameters so you can request custom views of cost management data. Key concepts:\n- grouping: equivalent to GROUP BY, this requires table dimensions to be selected or a Tag Key. Tag Key and Tag Value may be specified in the format key:value in the user prompt.\n- aggregate: Aggregation clause, only sum is supported\n- granularity: groups results into Daily or Monthly datasets useful for trends over time. Otherwise use None \n- timeperiod: the time period for the query, must be specified. The maximum range is 1 year (when creating a time period for a year be ensure it is less than a year by making it 2 days less than a full year). If no time period is specified by the user default to the last full month. \n\nParameters for filtering are not generated, if a user request information for a specific datavalue, use grouping on that dimension and then when responding only return the relavent datarows.\n\n### Supported Table Dimensions for Grouping\n- MeterCategory: Equivalent to the resource or service type.\n- ResourceLocation: Geographic region where the resource is deployed.\n- ResourceGuid: Unique id for each resource.\n- ResourceGroupName: Resource group containing the resource.\n- PricingModel: These are Savings Plans where per usage prices are lower if a user commits up front to usage. Pricing Models include pay-as-you-go, reserved and more.\n- BenefitName: Discounts or incentives (e.g., free credits, dev/test discounts), this is not a Savings Plan.\n\n## Tool: cost_management_forecast_plugin\n\n### Parameters\n cost_management_forecast_plugin accepts SQL-like parameters so you can request custom views of cost management forecast. Key concepts:\n- filter: like WHERE , used to filter by specific datavalues in specific table dimensions or using Tag keys and Tag values. Tag Key and Tag Value may be specified in the format key:value in the user prompt.\n- granularity: groups results into Daily or Monthly datasets useful for trends over time. Otherwise use None \n- timeperiod: the time period for the forecast, the to date cannot be in past. If no time period is specified by the user default to the next full month.\n\n### Supported Table Dimensions for Filtering\n- MeterCategory: Equivalent to the resource/service type.\n- ResourceLocation: Geographic region where the resource is deployed.\n- ResourceGuid: Unique id for each resource.\n- ResourceGroupName: Resource group containing the resource.\n- PricingModel: These are Savings Plans where per usage prices are lower if a user commits up front to usage. Pricing Models include pay-as-you-go, reserved and more.\n- BenefitName: Discounts or incentives (e.g., free credits, dev/test discounts), this is not a Savings Plan.\n\n### Datavalues for filtering\nIf filtering on a table dimension, datavalues for filters must be first fetched by calling cost_management_query_plugin and using grouping with the same table dimension.\nThe returned data will have the distinct datavalues for that dimension. Create a filter using the time dimension and relevant datavalues.\n\n## Today's Date\nToday's date is {TODAYS_DATE} in YYYY-MM-DD format.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"message": {"type": "string", "description": "The message or request to send to the agent"}}, "required": ["message"]}}, {"name": "cost_management_query_plugin", "description": "Get cost information for Azure, all returned costs are Actual costs.
