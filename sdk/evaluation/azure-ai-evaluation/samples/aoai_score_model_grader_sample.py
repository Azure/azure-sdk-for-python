Sample demonstrating the use of AzureOpenAIScoreModelGrader for continuous
scoring evaluation.

This sample shows how to:
1. Configure an Azure OpenAI model for grading
2. Create a score model grader with custom prompts
3. Run evaluation using the evaluate() method with both foundry and hub-based projects
4. Interpret continuous scoring results

Prerequisites:
- Azure OpenAI resource with API key and endpoint
- Model deployment (e.g., gpt-4, gpt-4o-mini)
- Sample conversation data in JSONL format
- Environment variables configured in .env file
- Azure AI project configuration (either foundry-based or hub-based)

Azure AI Project Configuration Options:
1. Foundry-based project (recommended):
   - AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT
2. Hub-based project (legacy):
   - AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
   - AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME  
   - AZURE_PROJECT_NAME
