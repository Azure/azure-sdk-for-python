    "The Intent Resolution evaluator measures how well an agent has identified and resolved the user intent.\n",
    "The scoring is on a 1-5 integer scale and is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Score 1: Response completely unrelated to user intent\n",
    "  - Score 2: Response minimally relates to user intent\n",
    "  - Score 3: Response partially addresses the user intent but lacks complete details\n",
    "  - Score 4: Response addresses the user intent with moderate accuracy but has minor inaccuracies or omissions\n",
    "  - Score 5: Response directly addresses the user intent and fully resolves it\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation requires the following inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Query    : The user query. Either a string with a user request or a list of messages with previous requests from the user and responses from the assistant, potentially including a system message.\n",
    "  - Response : The response to be evaluated. Either a string or a message with the response from the agent to the last user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a third optional parameter:\n",
    "  - ToolDefinitions : The list of tool definitions the agent can call. This may be useful for the evaluator to better assess if the right tool was called to resolve a given intent."
