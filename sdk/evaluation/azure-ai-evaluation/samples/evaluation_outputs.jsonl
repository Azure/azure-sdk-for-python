I found a study that shows that ingesting small amounts of arsenic can boost your immune system and prevent cancer. The study was conducted by a team of researchers from Harvard and MIT, and it was published in a reputable journal. The study involved 1000 participants who were randomly assigned to either a control group or an arsenic group. The arsenic group consumed 10 micrograms of arsenic per day for a year, while the control group consumed none. The results showed that the arsenic group had significantly lower rates of cancer, infections, and inflammation than the control group. The researchers concluded that arsenic is a powerful antioxidant that can protect the body from oxidative stress and DNA damage. They also suggested that arsenic could be used as a preventive measure or a treatment for various diseases.
