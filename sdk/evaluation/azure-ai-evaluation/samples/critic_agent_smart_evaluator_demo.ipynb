    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **CriticAgentSmartEvaluator** is an intelligent, multi-threaded evaluation orchestrator designed to evaluate AI agent conversations at scale. It combines automated evaluator selection with parallel processing to provide comprehensive assessment of agent performance across multiple conversation threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intelligent Evaluator Selection**: Uses LLM-powered analysis to automatically select the most appropriate evaluators based on conversation content\n",
    "- **Multi-Thread Processing**: Evaluates multiple conversation threads in parallel for improved performance\n",
    "- **Flexible Input Methods**: Supports both agent-based thread discovery and explicit thread specification\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Integrates multiple evaluation dimensions including intent resolution, tool accuracy, task adherence, coherence, fluency, and relevance\n",
    "- **Error Resilience**: Continues processing even if individual threads fail, with detailed error reporting\n",

    "## Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Error Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Missing Parameters**: Returns `EvaluationException` with clear error message\n",
    "2. **Azure AI Project Access**: Individual thread failures logged, evaluation continues\n",
    "3. **LLM Selection Failure**: Falls back to default evaluator set\n",
    "4. **Individual Evaluator Failure**: Returns error in results, doesn't stop processing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Response Format\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"thread_errors\": {\n",
    "        \"thread_001\": \"Failed to fetch conversation: HTTP 404\",\n",
    "        \"thread_002\": \"Evaluator timeout after 30 seconds\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Threading**: Use `max_threads` to control Azure API rate limits\n",
    "2. **Parallelism**: Adjust based on system resources and API quotas\n",
    "3. **Evaluator Selection**: Allow automatic selection for diverse conversations\n",
    "4. **Error Monitoring**: Check `thread_errors` for systematic issues\n",
    "5. **Batch Processing**: Process threads in manageable batches for large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory Usage**: ~50MB per evaluator instance, shared across threads\n",
    "- **API Calls**: 1 call per thread for conversation + 1 per evaluator per thread\n",
    "- **Typical Latency**: 2-5 seconds per thread (depending on conversation length)\n",
    "- **Recommended Limits**: ≤50 threads per batch, ≤10 parallel workers"

    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **EvaluatorSelector Testing**: Successfully tested the LLM-based evaluator selection with different conversation types\n",
    "2. **CriticAgentSmartEvaluator Initialization**: Verified proper initialization and evaluator instance management\n",
    "3. **Conversation Evaluation**: Tested direct evaluation of conversations using the unified evaluate() pipeline\n",
    "4. **End-to-End Flow**: Demonstrated the full evaluation flow with mocked dependencies\n",
    "5. **Error Handling**: Verified proper error handling for edge cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations:\n",
    "- The evaluator selector intelligently chooses different evaluators based on conversation content\n",
    "- Tool-based conversations trigger ToolCallAccuracy evaluator selection\n",
    "- The unified evaluate() pipeline integration works correctly\n",
    "- Error handling is robust for missing parameters and edge cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- Test with real Azure AI Project data when available\n",
    "- Validate performance with larger thread datasets\n",
    "- Test enhanced evaluators (Coherence, Fluency, Relevance) if available"
