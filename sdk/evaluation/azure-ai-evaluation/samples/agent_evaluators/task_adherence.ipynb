    "Set these environment variables with your own values:\n",
    "1) **PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING** - The project connection string, as found in the overview page of your Azure AI Foundry project.\n",
    "2) **MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME** - The deployment name of the AI model, as found under the \"Name\" column in the \"Models + endpoints\" tab in your Azure AI Foundry project.\n",
    "3) **AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT** - Azure Open AI Endpoint to be used for evaluation.\n",
    "4) **AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY** - Azure Open AI Key to be used for evaluation.\n",
    "5) **AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION** - Azure Open AI Api version to be used for evaluation.\n",

    "  - Score 3: Moderately Adherent\n",

Apply a 2-3 inch layer of organic mulch around the base of the plants to conserve moisture and regulate soil temperature.
