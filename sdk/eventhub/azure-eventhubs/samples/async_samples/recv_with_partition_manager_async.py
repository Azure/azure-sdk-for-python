"""
An example to show receiving events from an Event Hub with partition manager asynchronously.
In the `receive` method of `EventHubConsumerClient`:
If no partition id is specified, the partition_manager are used for load-balance and checkpoint.
If partition id is specified, the partition_manager can only be used for checkpoint.
