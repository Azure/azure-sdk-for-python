    :type event_hub_path: str
    :param network_tracing: Whether to output network trace logs to the logger. Default
     is `False`.
    :type network_tracing: bool
    :param credential: The credential object used for authentication which implements particular interface
     of getting tokens. It accepts ~azure.eventhub.EventHubSharedKeyCredential,
     ~azure.eventhub.EventHubSASTokenCredential, credential objects generated by the azure-identity library and
     objects that implement get_token(self, *scopes) method.
    :param http_proxy: HTTP proxy settings. This must be a dictionary with the following
     keys: 'proxy_hostname' (str value) and 'proxy_port' (int value).
     Additionally the following keys may also be present: 'username', 'password'.
    :type http_proxy: dict[str, Any]
    :param auth_timeout: The time in seconds to wait for a token to be authorized by the service.
     The default value is 60 seconds. If set to 0, no timeout will be enforced from the client.
    :type auth_timeout: float
    :param user_agent: The user agent that needs to be appended to the built in user agent string.
    :type user_agent: str
    :param retry_total: The total number of attempts to redo the failed operation when an error happened. Default
     value is 3.
    :type retry_total: int
    :keyword transport_type: The type of transport protocol that will be used for communicating with
     the Event Hubs service. Default is ~azure.eventhub.TransportType.Amqp.
        :class: ~azure.eventhub.TransportType
    :keyword partition_manager: stores the load balancing data and checkpoint data when receiving events
     if partition_manager is specified. If it's None, this EventHubConsumerClient instance will receive
     events without load balancing and checkpoint.
        :class: subclass of ~azure.eventhub.PartitionManager
    :keyword float load_balancing_interval: When load balancing kicks in, this is the interval in seconds
     between two load balancing. Default is 10.

         time. The callback takes two parameters: `partition_context` which contains partition information
          and `error` being the exception.  Please define the callback like `on_error(partition_context, error)`.

         partition finishes initialization. The callback takes onw parameter: `partition_context` which contains
          the partition information. Please define the callback like
          `on_partition_initialize(partition_context)`.
        :keyword on_partition_close: The callback function which will be called after a consumer for certain
         partition is closed. The callback takes two parameters: `partition_context` which contains partition
         information and `reason` for the close. Please define the callback like `on_error(partition_context, reason)`.
