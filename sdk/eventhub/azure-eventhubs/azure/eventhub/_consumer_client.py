class EventHubConsumerClient(ClientBase):
    """ The EventHubProducerClient class defines a high level interface for
    receiving events from the Azure Event Hubs service.

    The main goal of `EventHubConsumerClient` is to receive events from all partitions of an EventHub with
    load balancing and checkpointing.

    When multiple `EventHubConsumerClient` works with one process, multiple processes, or multiple computer machines
    and if they use the same repository as the load balancing and checkpointing store, they will balance automatically.
    To enable the load balancing and / or checkpointing, partition_manager must be set when creating the
    `EventHubConsumerClient`.

    An `EventHubConsumerClient` can also receive from a specific partition when you call its method `receive()`
    and specify the partition_id.
    Load balancing won't work in single-partition mode. But users can still save checkpoint if the partition_manager
    is set.

    :param str host: The hostname of the Event Hub.
    :param str event_hub_path: The path of the specific Event Hub to connect the client to.
    :param credential: The credential object used for authentication which implements particular interface
     of getting tokens. It accepts :class:`EventHubSharedKeyCredential<azure.eventhub.EventHubSharedKeyCredential>`,
     :class:`EventHubSASTokenCredential<azure.eventhub.EventHubSASTokenCredential>`, or credential objects generated by
     the azure-identity library and objects that implement `get_token(self, *scopes)` method.
    :keyword bool logging_enable: Whether to output network trace logs to the logger. Default is `False`.
    :keyword float auth_timeout: The time in seconds to wait for a token to be authorized by the service.
     The default value is 60 seconds. If set to 0, no timeout will be enforced from the client.
    :keyword str user_agent: The user agent that needs to be appended to the built in user agent string.
    :keyword int retry_total: The total number of attempts to redo the failed operation when an error happened. Default
     value is 3.
    :keyword transport_type: The type of transport protocol that will be used for communicating with
     the Event Hubs service. Default is `TransportType.Amqp`.
    :paramtype transport_type: ~azure.eventhub.TransportType
    :keyword dict http_proxy: HTTP proxy settings. This must be a dictionary with the following
     keys: 'proxy_hostname' (str value) and 'proxy_port' (int value).
     Additionally the following keys may also be present: 'username', 'password'.
    :keyword partition_manager: stores the load balancing data and checkpoint data when receiving events
     if partition_manager is specified. If it's None, this `EventHubConsumerClient` instance will receive
     events without load balancing and checkpoint.
    :paramtype partition_manager: ~azure.eventhub.PartitionManager
    :keyword float load_balancing_interval: When load balancing kicks in, this is the interval in seconds
     between two load balancing. Default is 10.
