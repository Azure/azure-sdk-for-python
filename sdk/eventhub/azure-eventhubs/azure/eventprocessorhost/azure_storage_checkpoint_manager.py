    Manages checkpoints and lease with azure storage blobs. In this implementation,
    checkpoints are data that's actually in the lease blob, so checkpoint operations
    turn into lease operations under the covers.

    :param str storage_account_name: The storage account name. This is used to
     authenticate requests signed with an account key and to construct the storage
     endpoint. It is required unless a connection string is given.
    :param str storage_account_key: The storage account key. This is used for shared key
     authentication. If neither account key or sas token is specified, anonymous access
     will be used.
    :param str lease_container_name: The name of the container that will be used to store
     leases. If it does not already exist it will be created. Default value is 'eph-leases'.
     Leases are named via internal partition_ids, locations can be modified via
     storage_blob_prefix and use_consumer_group_as_directory.
    :param str storage_blob_prefix: If populated, prepends a prefix when constructing
     the location that leases are stored within the lease_container. Default None.
     If consumer_group_as_directory is also provided, it is unified as such <prefix><group>/<id>.
    :param int lease_renew_interval: The interval in seconds at which EPH will attempt to
     renew the lease of a particular partition. Default value is 10.
    :param int lease_duration: The duration in seconds of a lease on a partition.
     Default value is 30.
    :param str sas_token: A shared access signature token to use to authenticate requests
     instead of the account key. If account key and sas token are both specified,
     account key will be used to sign. If neither are specified, anonymous access will be used.
    :param str endpoint_suffix: The host base component of the url, minus the account name.
     Defaults to Azure (core.windows.net). Override this to use a National Cloud.
    :param str connection_string: If specified, this will override all other endpoint parameters.
     See http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-configure-connection-string/
     for the connection string format.
    :param bool use_consumer_group_as_directory: If true, includes the consumer group as part of the
     location we use to store leases within the container, as such:  <consumer_group>/<partition_id>, 
     otherwise leases are simply named by their partition_id.  Default False.
     If storage_blob_prefix is provided this prefix will be prepended in either case.
