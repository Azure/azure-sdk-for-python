class EventHubConsumerClient(ClientBaseAsync):
    """The EventHubConsumerClient class defines a high level interface for
    receiving events from the Azure Event Hubs service.

    The main goal of `EventHubConsumerClient` is to receive events from all partitions of an EventHub with
    load-balancing and checkpointing.

    When multiple `EventHubConsumerClients are running against the same event hub, consumer group and checkpointing
    location, the partitions will be evenly distributed among them.

    To enable load-balancing and persisted checkpoints, checkpoint_store must be set when creating the
    `EventHubConsumerClient`.
    If a checkpoint store is not provided, the checkpoint will be maintained internally in memory.

    An `EventHubConsumerClient` can also receive from a specific partition when you call its method `receive()`
    and specify the partition_id.
    Load-balancing won't work in single-partition mode. But users can still save checkpoints if the checkpoint_store
    is set.

    :param str fully_qualified_namespace: The fully qualified host name for the Event Hubs namespace.
     The namespace format is: `<yournamespace>.servicebus.windows.net`.
    :param str eventhub_name: The path of the specific Event Hub to connect the client to.
    :param str consumer_group: Receive events from the event hub for this consumer group.
    :param ~azure.core.credentials.TokenCredential credential: The credential object used for authentication which
     implements a particular interface for getting tokens. It accepts
     :class:`EventHubSharedKeyCredential<azure.eventhub.aio.EventHubSharedKeyCredential>`, or credential objects
     generated by the azure-identity library and objects that implement the `get_token(self, *scopes)` method.
    :keyword bool logging_enable: Whether to output network trace logs to the logger. Default is `False`.
    :keyword float auth_timeout: The time in seconds to wait for a token to be authorized by the service.
     The default value is 60 seconds. If set to 0, no timeout will be enforced from the client.
    :keyword str user_agent: The user agent that should be appended to the built-in user agent string.
    :keyword int retry_total: The total number of attempts to redo a failed operation when an error occurs.
     Default value is 3. The context of `retry_total` in receiving is special: The `receive` method is implemented
     by a while-loop calling internal receive method in each iteration. In the `receive` case,
     `retry_total` specifies the numbers of retry after error raised by internal receive method in the while-loop.
     If retry attempts are exhausted, the `on_error` callback will be called (if provided) with the error information.
     The failed internal partition consumer will be closed (`on_partition_close` will be called if provided) and
     new internal partition consumer will be created (`on_partition_initialize` will be called if provided) to resume
     receiving.
    :keyword float idle_timeout: Timeout, in seconds, after which this client will close the underlying connection
     if there is no further activity. By default the value is None, meaning that the client will not shutdown due to
     inactivity unless initiated by the service.
    :keyword transport_type: The type of transport protocol that will be used for communicating with
     the Event Hubs service. Default is `TransportType.Amqp`.
    :paramtype transport_type: ~azure.eventhub.TransportType
    :keyword dict http_proxy: HTTP proxy settings. This must be a dictionary with the following
     keys: `'proxy_hostname'` (str value) and `'proxy_port'` (int value).
     Additionally the following keys may also be present: `'username', 'password'`.
    :keyword checkpoint_store: A manager that stores the partition load-balancing and checkpoint data
     when receiving events. The checkpoint store will be used in both cases of receiving from all partitions
     or a single partition. In the latter case load-balancing does not apply.
     If a checkpoint store is not provided, the checkpoint will be maintained internally
     in memory, and the `EventHubConsumerClient` instance will receive events without load-balancing.
    :paramtype checkpoint_store: ~azure.eventhub.aio.CheckpointStore
    :keyword float load_balancing_interval: When load-balancing kicks in. This is the interval, in seconds,
     between two load-balancing evaluations. Default is 10 seconds.

         The callback takes a single parameter: `partition_context`
