     or a receive source.
    :type remote_address: str, bytes or ~uamqp.address.Address
    :param auth: Authentication for the connection. This should be one of the subclasses of
     uamqp.authentication.AMQPAuth. Currently this includes:
        - uamqp.authentication.SASLAnonymous
        - uamqp.authentication.SASLPlain
        - uamqp.authentication.SASTokenAsync
     If no authentication is supplied, SASLAnnoymous will be used by default.
    :type auth: ~uamqp.authentication.common.AMQPAuth
    :param client_name: The name for the client, also known as the Container ID.
     If no name is provided, a random GUID will be used.
    :type client_name: str or bytes
    :param loop: A user specified event loop.
    :type loop: ~asycnio.AbstractEventLoop
    :param debug: Whether to turn on network trace logs. If `True`, trace logs
     will be logged at INFO level. Default is `False`.
    :type debug: bool
    :param error_policy: A policy for parsing errors on link, connection and message
     disposition to determine whether the error should be retryable.
    :type error_policy: ~uamqp.errors.ErrorPolicy
    :param keep_alive_interval: If set, a thread will be started to keep the connection
     alive during periods of user inactivity. The value will determine how long the
     thread will sleep (in seconds) between pinging the connection. If 0 or None, no
     thread will be started.
    :type keep_alive_interval: int
    :param max_frame_size: Maximum AMQP frame size. Default is 63488 bytes.
    :type max_frame_size: int
    :param channel_max: Maximum number of Session channels in the Connection.
    :type channel_max: int
    :param idle_timeout: Timeout in seconds after which the Connection will close
     if there is no further activity.
    :type idle_timeout: int
    :param properties: Connection properties.
    :type properties: dict
    :param remote_idle_timeout_empty_frame_send_ratio: Ratio of empty frames to
     idle time for Connections with no activity. Value must be between
     0.0 and 1.0 inclusive. Default is 0.5.
    :type remote_idle_timeout_empty_frame_send_ratio: float

    :type incoming_window: int
    :param outgoing_window: The size of the allowed window for outgoing messages.
    :type outgoing_window: int
    :param handle_max: The maximum number of concurrent link handles.
    :type handle_max: int
    :param on_attach: A callback function to be run on receipt of an ATTACH frame.
     The function must take 4 arguments: source, target, properties and error.
    :type on_attach: func[~uamqp.address.Source, ~uamqp.address.Target, dict, ~uamqp.errors.AMQPConnectionError]
    :param send_settle_mode: The mode by which to settle message send
     operations. If set to `Unsettled`, the client will wait for a confirmation
     from the service that the message was successfully sent. If set to 'Settled',
     the client will not wait for confirmation and assume success.
    :type send_settle_mode: ~uamqp.constants.SenderSettleMode
    :param receive_settle_mode: The mode by which to settle message receive
     operations. If set to `PeekLock`, the receiver will lock a message once received until
     the client accepts or rejects the message. If set to `ReceiveAndDelete`, the service
     will assume successful receipt of the message and clear it from the queue. The
     default is `PeekLock`.
    :type receive_settle_mode: ~uamqp.constants.ReceiverSettleMode
    :param encoding: The encoding to use for parameters supplied as strings.
     Default is 'UTF-8'

     new messages are received after the specified timeout. If set to 0, the receiver
     will never timeout and will continue to listen. The default is 0.

     or via iterator. If the message has not been explicitly settled after processing
     the message will be accepted. Alternatively, when used with batch receive, this setting
     will determine whether the messages are pre-emptively settled during batching, or otherwise

     operations. If set to `PeekLock`, the receiver will lock a message once received until
     the client accepts or rejects the message. If set to `ReceiveAndDelete`, the service
     will assume successful receipt of the message and clear it from the queue. The
     default is `PeekLock`.
