    :param auth: Authentication for the connection. This should be one of the subclasses of
     uamqp.authentication.AMQPAuth. Currently this includes:
        - uamqp.authentication.SASLAnonymous
        - uamqp.authentication.SASLPlain
        - uamqp.authentication.SASTokenAuth
     If no authentication is supplied, SASLAnnoymous will be used by default.
    :type auth: ~uamqp.authentication.common.AMQPAuth
    :param client_name: The name for the client, also known as the Container ID.
     If no name is provided, a random GUID will be used.

     will be logged at INFO level. Default is `False`.

     disposition to determine whether the error should be retryable.
    :type retry_policy: ~uamqp.errors.RetryPolicy
    :param keep_alive_interval: If set, a thread will be started to keep the connection
     alive during periods of user inactivity. The value will determine how long the
     thread will sleep (in seconds) between pinging the connection. If 0 or None, no
     thread will be started.
    :type keep_alive_interval: int
    :param max_frame_size: Maximum AMQP frame size. Default is 63488 bytes.

    :param idle_timeout: Timeout in seconds after which the Connection will close
     if there is no further activity.
    :type idle_timeout: int
    :param auth_timeout: Timeout in seconds for CBS authentication. Otherwise this value will be ignored.
     Default value is 60s.
    :type auth_timeout: int
    :param properties: Connection properties.
    :type properties: dict
    :param remote_idle_timeout_empty_frame_send_ratio: Ratio of empty frames to
     idle time for Connections with no activity. Value must be between
     0.0 and 1.0 inclusive. Default is 0.5.
    :type remote_idle_timeout_empty_frame_send_ratio: float
    :param incoming_window: The size of the allowed window for incoming messages.
    :type incoming_window: int
    :param outgoing_window: The size of the allowed window for outgoing messages.
    :type outgoing_window: int
    :param handle_max: The maximum number of concurrent link handles.
    :type handle_max: int
    :param on_attach: A callback function to be run on receipt of an ATTACH frame.
     The function must take 4 arguments: source, target, properties and error.
    :type on_attach: func[~uamqp.address.Source, ~uamqp.address.Target, dict, ~uamqp.errors.AMQPConnectionError]

     operations. If set to `Unsettled`, the client will wait for a confirmation
     from the service that the message was successfully sent. If set to 'Settled',
     the client will not wait for confirmation and assume success.
    :type send_settle_mode: ~uamqp.constants.SenderSettleMode
    :param receive_settle_mode: The mode by which to settle message receive
     operations. If set to `PeekLock`, the receiver will lock a message once received until
     the client accepts or rejects the message. If set to `ReceiveAndDelete`, the service
     will assume successful receipt of the message and clear it from the queue. The
     default is `PeekLock`.
    :type receive_settle_mode: ~uamqp.constants.ReceiverSettleMode
