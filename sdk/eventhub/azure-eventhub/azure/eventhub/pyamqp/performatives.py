    OPEN performative. Negotiate Connection parameters.

    The first frame sent on a connection in either direction MUST contain an Open body.
    (Note that theConnection header which is sent first on the Connection is *not* a frame.)
    The fields indicate thecapabilities and limitations of the sending peer.

    :param str container_id: The ID of the source container.
    :param str hostname: The name of the target host.
        The dns name of the host (either fully qualified or relative) to which the sendingpeer is connecting.
        It is not mandatory to provide the hostname. If no hostname isprovided the receiving peer should select
        a default based on its own configuration.This field can be used by AMQP proxies to determine the correct
        back-end service toconnect the client to.This field may already have been specified by the sasl-init frame,
        if a SASL layer is used, or, the server name indication extension as described in RFC-4366, if a TLSlayer
        is used, in which case this field SHOULD be null or contain the same value. It is undefined what a different
        value to those already specific means.
    :param int max_frame_size: Proposed maximum frame size in bytes.
        The largest frame size that the sending peer is able to accept on this Connection.
        If this field is not set it means that the peer does not impose any specific limit. A peer MUST NOT send
        frames larger than its partner can handle. A peer that receives an oversized frame MUST close the Connection
        with the framing-error error-code. Both peers MUST accept frames of up to 512 (MIN-MAX-FRAME-SIZE)
        octets large.
    :param int channel_max: The maximum channel number that may be used on the Connection.
        The channel-max value is the highest channel number that may be used on the Connection. This value plus one
        is the maximum number of Sessions that can be simultaneously active on the Connection. A peer MUST not use
        channel numbers outside the range that its partner can handle. A peer that receives a channel number
        outside the supported range MUST close the Connection with the framing-error error-code.
    :param int idle_timeout: Idle time-out in milliseconds.
        The idle time-out required by the sender. A value of zero is the same as if it was not set (null). If the
        receiver is unable or unwilling to support the idle time-out then it should close the connection with
        an error explaining why (eg, because it is too small). If the value is not set, then the sender does not
        have an idle time-out. However, senders doing this should be aware that implementations MAY choose to use
        an internal default to efficiently manage a peer's resources.
    :param list(str) outgoing_locales: Locales available for outgoing text.
        A list of the locales that the peer supports for sending informational text. This includes Connection,
        Session and Link error descriptions. A peer MUST support at least the en-US locale. Since this value
        is always supported, it need not be supplied in the outgoing-locales. A null value or an empty list implies
        that only en-US is supported.
    :param list(str) incoming_locales: Desired locales for incoming text in decreasing level of preference.
        A list of locales that the sending peer permits for incoming informational text. This list is ordered in
        decreasing level of preference. The receiving partner will chose the first (most preferred) incoming locale
        from those which it supports. If none of the requested locales are supported, en-US will be chosen. Note
        that en-US need not be supplied in this list as it is always the fallback. A peer may determine which of the
        permitted incoming locales is chosen by examining the partner's supported locales asspecified in the
        outgoing_locales field. A null value or an empty list implies that only en-US is supported.
    :param list(str) offered_capabilities: The extension capabilities the sender supports.
        If the receiver of the offered-capabilities requires an extension capability which is not present in the
        offered-capability list then it MUST close the connection. A list of commonly defined connection capabilities
        and their meanings can be found here: http://www.amqp.org/specification/1.0/connection-capabilities.
    :param list(str) required_capabilities: The extension capabilities the sender may use if the receiver supports
        them. The desired-capability list defines which extension capabilities the sender MAY use if the receiver
        offers them (i.e. they are in the offered-capabilities list received by the sender of the
        desired-capabilities). If the receiver of the desired-capabilities offers extension capabilities which are
        not present in the desired-capability list it received, then it can be sure those (undesired) capabilities
        will not be used on the Connection.
    :param dict properties: Connection properties.
        The properties map contains a set of fields intended to indicate information about the connection and its
        container. A list of commonly defined connection properties and their meanings can be found

    :param int next_outgoing_id: The transfer-id of the first transfer id the sender will send.
        The next-outgoing-id is used to assign a unique transfer-id to all outgoing transfer frames on a given

    ATTACH performative. Attach a Link to a Session.

    The attach frame indicates that a Link Endpoint has been attached to the Session. The opening flag
    is used to indicate that the Link Endpoint is newly created.

    :param str name: The name of the link.
        This name uniquely identifies the link from the container of the source to the container of the target
        node, e.g. if the container of the source node is A, and the container of the target node is B, the link
        may be globally identified by the (ordered) tuple(A,B,<name>).
    :param int handle: The handle of the link.
        The handle MUST NOT be used for other open Links. An attempt to attach using a handle which is already
        associated with a Link MUST be responded to with an immediate close carrying a Handle-in-usesession-error.
        To make it easier to monitor AMQP link attach frames, it is recommended that implementations always assign

    :param bool role: The role of the link endpoint. Either Role.Sender (False) or Role.Receiver (True).
    :param str send_settle_mode: The settlement mode for the Sender.
        Determines the settlement policy for deliveries sent at the Sender. When set at the Receiver this indicates
        the desired value for the settlement mode at the Sender. When set at the Sender this indicates the actual
        settlement mode in use.
    :param str rcv_settle_mode: The settlement mode of the Receiver.
        Determines the settlement policy for unsettled deliveries received at the Receiver. When set at the Sender
        this indicates the desired value for the settlement mode at the Receiver. When set at the Receiver this
        indicates the actual settlement mode in use.
    :param ~uamqp.messaging.Source source: The source for Messages.
        If no source is specified on an outgoing Link, then there is no source currently attached to the Link.
        A Link with no source will never produce outgoing Messages.
    :param ~uamqp.messaging.Target target: The target for Messages.
        If no target is specified on an incoming Link, then there is no target currently attached to the Link.
        A Link with no target will never permit incoming Messages.
    :param dict unsettled: Unsettled delivery state.
        This is used to indicate any unsettled delivery states when a suspended link is resumed. The map is keyed
        by delivery-tag with values indicating the delivery state. The local and remote delivery states for a given
        delivery-tag MUST be compared to resolve any in-doubt deliveries. If necessary, deliveries MAY be resent,
        or resumed based on the outcome of this comparison. If the local unsettled map is too large to be encoded
        within a frame of the agreed maximum frame size then the session may be ended with the
        frame-size-too-smallerror. The endpoint SHOULD make use of the ability to send an incomplete unsettled map
        to avoid sending an error. The unsettled map MUST NOT contain null valued keys. When reattaching
        (as opposed to resuming), the unsettled map MUST be null.
    :param bool incomplete_unsettled:
        If set to true this field indicates that the unsettled map provided is not complete. When the map is
        incomplete the recipient of the map cannot take the absence of a delivery tag from the map as evidence of
        settlement. On receipt of an incomplete unsettled map a sending endpoint MUST NOT send any new deliveries
        (i.e. deliveries where resume is not set to true) to its partner (and a receiving endpoint which sent an
        incomplete unsettled map MUST detach with an error on receiving a transfer which does not have the resume
        flag set to true).
    :param int initial_delivery_count: This MUST NOT be null if role is sender,
        and it is ignored if the role is receiver.
    :param int max_message_size: The maximum message size supported by the link endpoint.
        This field indicates the maximum message size supported by the link endpoint. Any attempt to deliver a
        message larger than this results in a message-size-exceeded link-error. If this field is zero or unset,
        there is no maximum size imposed by the link endpoint.

    TRANSFER performative. Transfer a Message.

    The transfer frame is used to send Messages across a Link. Messages may be carried by a single transfer up

    transfer frames.

    :param int handle: Specifies the Link on which the Message is transferred.
    :param int delivery_id: Alias for delivery-tag.
        The delivery-id MUST be supplied on the first transfer of a multi-transfer delivery. On continuation
        transfers the delivery-id MAY be omitted. It is an error if the delivery-id on a continuation transfer
        differs from the delivery-id on the first transfer of a delivery.
    :param bytes delivery_tag: Uniquely identifies the delivery attempt for a given Message on this Link.
        This field MUST be specified for the first transfer of a multi transfer message and may only be
        omitted for continuation transfers.
    :param int message_format: Indicates the message format.
        This field MUST be specified for the first transfer of a multi transfer message and may only be omitted
        for continuation transfers.
    :param bool settled: If not set on the first (or only) transfer for a delivery, then the settled flag MUST
        be interpreted as being false. For subsequent transfers if the settled flag is left unset then it MUST be
        interpreted as true if and only if the value of the settled flag on any of the preceding transfers was
        true; if no preceding transfer was sent with settled being true then the value when unset MUST be taken
        as false. If the negotiated value for snd-settle-mode at attachment is settled, then this field MUST be
        true on at least one transfer frame for a delivery (i.e. the delivery must be settled at the Sender at
        the point the delivery has been completely transferred). If the negotiated value for snd-settle-mode at
        attachment is unsettled, then this field MUST be false (or unset) on every transfer frame for a delivery
        (unless the delivery is aborted).
    :param bool more: Indicates that the Message has more content.
        Note that if both the more and aborted fields are set to true, the aborted flag takes precedence. That is
        a receiver should ignore the value of the more field if the transfer is marked as aborted. A sender
        SHOULD NOT set the more flag to true if it also sets the aborted flag to true.
    :param str rcv_settle_mode: If first, this indicates that the Receiver MUST settle the delivery once it has
        arrived without waiting for the Sender to settle first. If second, this indicates that the Receiver MUST
        NOT settle until sending its disposition to the Sender and receiving a settled disposition from the sender.
        If not set, this value is defaulted to the value negotiated on link attach. If the negotiated link value is
        first, then it is illegal to set this field to second. If the message is being sent settled by the Sender,
        the value of this field is ignored. The (implicit or explicit) value of this field does not form part of the
        transfer state, and is not retained if a link is suspended and subsequently resumed.
    :param bytes state: The state of the delivery at the sender.
        When set this informs the receiver of the state of the delivery at the sender. This is particularly useful
        when transfers of unsettled deliveries are resumed after a resuming a link. Setting the state on the
        transfer can be thought of as being equivalent to sending a disposition immediately before the transfer
        performative, i.e. it is the state of the delivery (not the transfer) that existed at the point the frame
        was sent. Note that if the transfer performative (or an earlier disposition performative referring to the
        delivery) indicates that the delivery has attained a terminal state, then no future transfer or disposition
        sent by the sender can alter that terminal state.
    :param bool resume: Indicates a resumed delivery.
        If true, the resume flag indicates that the transfer is being used to reassociate an unsettled delivery
        from a dissociated link endpoint. The receiver MUST ignore resumed deliveries that are not in its local
        unsettled map. The sender MUST NOT send resumed transfers for deliveries not in its local unsettledmap.
        If a resumed delivery spans more than one transfer performative, then the resume flag MUST be set to true
        on the first transfer of the resumed delivery. For subsequent transfers for the same delivery the resume
        flag may be set to true, or may be omitted. In the case where the exchange of unsettled maps makes clear
        that all message data has been successfully transferred to the receiver, and that only the final state
        (andpotentially settlement) at the sender needs to be conveyed, then a resumed delivery may carry no
        payload and instead act solely as a vehicle for carrying the terminal state of the delivery at the sender.
    :param bool aborted: Indicates that the Message is aborted.
        Aborted Messages should be discarded by the recipient (any payload within the frame carrying the performative
        MUST be ignored). An aborted Message is implicitly settled.
    :param bool batchable: Batchable hint.
        If true, then the issuer is hinting that there is no need for the peer to urgently communicate updated
        delivery state. This hint may be used to artificially increase the amount of batching an implementation
        uses when communicating delivery states, and thereby save bandwidth. If the message being delivered is too
        large to fit within a single frame, then the setting of batchable to true on any of the transfer
        performatives for the delivery is equivalent to setting batchable to true for all the transfer performatives
        for the delivery. The batchable value does not form part of the transfer state, and is not retained if a
        link is suspended and subsequently resumed.
