    """The EventHubProducerClient class defines a high level interface for
    sending events to the Azure Event Hubs service.

    :param str fully_qualified_namespace: The fully qualified host name for the Event Hubs namespace.
     This is likely to be similar to <yournamespace>.servicebus.windows.net
    :param str eventhub_name: The path of the specific Event Hub to connect the client to.
    :param credential: The credential object used for authentication which
     implements a particular interface for getting tokens. It accepts
     :class:`EventHubSharedKeyCredential<azure.eventhub.EventHubSharedKeyCredential>`, or credential objects generated
     by the azure-identity library and objects that implement the `get_token(self, *scopes)` method.
    :type credential: ~azure.core.credentials.TokenCredential or ~azure.core.credentials.AzureSasCredential
     or ~azure.core.credentials.AzureNamedKeyCredential
    :keyword bool buffered_mode: If True, the producer client will collect events in a buffer, efficiently batch,
     then publish. Default is False.
    :keyword buffer_concurrency: The ThreadPoolExecutor to be used for publishing events
     or the number of workers for the ThreadPoolExecutor. Default is None and a ThreadPoolExecutor
     with the default number of workers will be created per
     https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor
    :paramtype buffer_concurrency: ThreadPoolExecutor or int or None
    :keyword on_success: The callback to be called once a batch has been successfully published.
     The callback takes two parameters:
        - `events`: The list of events that have been successfully published
        - `partition_id`: The partition id that the events in the list have been published to.
     The callback function should be defined like: `on_success(events, partition_id)`.
     It is required when `buffered_mode` is True while optional if `buffered_mode` is False.
    :paramtype on_success: Optional[Callable[[SendEventTypes, Optional[str]], None]]
    :keyword on_error: The callback to be called once a batch has failed to be published.
     The callback function should be defined like: `on_error(events, partition_id, error)`, where:
        - `events`: The list of events that failed to be published,
        - `partition_id`: The partition id that the events in the list have been tried to be published to and
        - `error`: The exception related to the sending failure.
     If `buffered_mode` is False, `on_error` callback is optional and errors will be handled as follows:
        - If an `on_error` callback is passed during the producer client instantiation,
            then error information will be passed to the `on_error` callback, which will then be called.
        - If an `on_error` callback is not passed in during client instantiation,
            then the error will be raised by default.
     If `buffered_mode` is True, `on_error` callback is required and errors will be handled as follows:
        - If events fail to enqueue within the given timeout, then an error will be directly raised.
        - If events fail to send after enqueuing successfully, the `on_error` callback will be called.
    :paramtype on_error: Optional[Callable[[SendEventTypes, Optional[str], Exception], None]]
    :keyword int max_buffer_length: Buffered mode only.
     The total number of events per partition that can be buffered before a flush will be triggered.
     The default value is 1500 in buffered mode.
    :keyword Optional[float] max_wait_time: Buffered mode only.
     The amount of time to wait for a batch to be built with events in the buffer before publishing.
     The default value is 1 in buffered mode.
    :keyword bool logging_enable: Whether to output network trace logs to the logger. Default is `False`.
    :keyword float auth_timeout: The time in seconds to wait for a token to be authorized by the service.
     The default value is 60 seconds. If set to 0, no timeout will be enforced from the client.
    :keyword str user_agent: If specified, this will be added in front of the user agent string.
    :keyword retry_total: The total number of attempts to redo a failed operation when an error occurs. Default
     value is 3.
    :paramtype retry_total: int
    :keyword float retry_backoff_factor: A backoff factor to apply between attempts after the second try
     (most errors are resolved immediately by a second try without a delay).
     In fixed mode, retry policy will always sleep for {backoff factor}.
     In 'exponential' mode, retry policy will sleep for: `{backoff factor} * (2 ** ({number of total retries} - 1))`
     seconds. If the backoff_factor is 0.1, then the retry will sleep
     for [0.0s, 0.2s, 0.4s, ...] between retries. The default value is 0.8.
    :keyword float retry_backoff_max: The maximum back off time. Default value is 120 seconds (2 minutes).
    :keyword retry_mode: The delay behavior between retry attempts. Supported values are 'fixed' or 'exponential',
     where default is 'exponential'.
    :paramtype retry_mode: str
    :keyword float idle_timeout: Timeout, in seconds, after which this client will close the underlying connection
     if there is no activity. By default the value is None, meaning that the client will not shutdown due to inactivity
     unless initiated by the service.
    :keyword transport_type: The type of transport protocol that will be used for communicating with
     the Event Hubs service. Default is `TransportType.Amqp` in which case port 5671 is used.
     If the port 5671 is unavailable/blocked in the network environment, `TransportType.AmqpOverWebsocket` could
     be used instead which uses port 443 for communication.
    :paramtype transport_type: ~azure.eventhub.TransportType
    :keyword Dict http_proxy: HTTP proxy settings. This must be a dictionary with the following
     keys: `'proxy_hostname'` (str value) and `'proxy_port'` (int value).
     Additionally the following keys may also be present: `'username', 'password'`.
    :keyword custom_endpoint_address: The custom endpoint address to use for establishing a connection to
     the Event Hubs service, allowing network requests to be routed through any application gateways or
     other paths needed for the host environment. Default is None.
     The format would be like "sb://<custom_endpoint_hostname>:<custom_endpoint_port>".
     If port is not specified in the `custom_endpoint_address`, by default port 443 will be used.
    :paramtype custom_endpoint_address: Optional[str]
    :keyword connection_verify: Path to the custom CA_BUNDLE file of the SSL certificate which is used to
     authenticate the identity of the connection endpoint.
     Default is None in which case `certifi.where()` will be used.
    :paramtype connection_verify: Optional[str]
    :keyword uamqp_transport: Whether to use the `uamqp` library as the underlying transport. The default value is
     False and the Pure Python AMQP library will be used as the underlying transport.
    :paramtype uamqp_transport: bool
    :keyword float socket_timeout: The time in seconds that the underlying socket on the connection should
     wait when sending and receiving data before timing out. The default value is 0.2 for TransportType.Amqp
     and 1 for TransportType.AmqpOverWebsocket. If EventHubsConnectionError errors are occurring due to write
     timing out, a larger than default value may need to be passed in. This is for advanced usage scenarios
     and ordinarily the default value should be sufficient.

         The callback takes two parameters:
            - `events`: The list of events that have been successfully published
            - `partition_id`: The partition id that the events in the list have been published to.
         The callback function should be defined like: `on_success(events, partition_id)`.
         Required when `buffered_mode` is True while optional if `buffered_mode` is False.
        :paramtype on_success: Optional[Callable[[SendEventTypes, Optional[str]], None]]
        :keyword on_error: The callback to be called once a batch has failed to be published.
         Required when in `buffered_mode` is True while optional if `buffered_mode` is False.
         The callback function should be defined like: `on_error(events, partition_id, error)`, where:
            - `events`: The list of events that failed to be published,
            - `partition_id`: The partition id that the events in the list have been tried to be published to and
            - `error`: The exception related to the sending failure.
         If `buffered_mode` is False, `on_error` callback is optional and errors will be handled as follows:
            - If an `on_error` callback is passed during the producer client instantiation,
                then error information will be passed to the `on_error` callback, which will then be called.
            - If an `on_error` callback is not passed in during client instantiation,
                then the error will be raised by default.
         If `buffered_mode` is True, `on_error` callback is required and errors will be handled as follows:
            - If events fail to enqueue within the given timeout, then an error will be directly raised.
            - If events fail to send after enqueuing successfully, the `on_error` callback will be called.
        :paramtype on_error: Optional[Callable[[SendEventTypes, Optional[str], Exception], None]]
        :keyword int max_buffer_length: Buffered mode only.
         The total number of events per partition that can be buffered before a flush will be triggered.
         The default value is 1500 in buffered mode.
        :keyword Optional[float] max_wait_time: Buffered mode only.
         The amount of time to wait for a batch to be built with events in the buffer before publishing.
         The default value is 1 in buffered mode.
        :keyword bool logging_enable: Whether to output network trace logs to the logger. Default is `False`.
        :keyword dict http_proxy: HTTP proxy settings. This must be a dictionary with the following
         keys: `'proxy_hostname'` (str value) and `'proxy_port'` (int value).
         Additionally the following keys may also be present: `'username', 'password'`.
        :keyword float auth_timeout: The time in seconds to wait for a token to be authorized by the service.
         The default value is 60 seconds. If set to 0, no timeout will be enforced from the client.
        :keyword str user_agent: If specified, this will be added in front of the user agent string.
        :keyword retry_total: The total number of attempts to redo a failed operation when an error occurs.
         Default value is 3.
        :paramtype retry_total: int
        :keyword float retry_backoff_factor: A backoff factor to apply between attempts after the second try
         (most errors are resolved immediately by a second try without a delay).
         In fixed mode, retry policy will always sleep for {backoff factor}.
         In 'exponential' mode, retry policy will sleep for: `{backoff factor} * (2 ** ({number of total retries} - 1))`
         seconds. If the backoff_factor is 0.1, then the retry will sleep
         for [0.0s, 0.2s, 0.4s, ...] between retries. The default value is 0.8.
        :keyword float retry_backoff_max: The maximum back off time. Default value is 120 seconds (2 minutes).
        :keyword retry_mode: The delay behavior between retry attempts. Supported values are 'fixed' or 'exponential',
         where default is 'exponential'.
        :paramtype retry_mode: str
        :keyword float idle_timeout: Timeout, in seconds, after which this client will close the underlying connection
         if there is no activity. By default the value is None, meaning that the client will not shutdown due to
         inactivity unless initiated by the service.
        :keyword transport_type: The type of transport protocol that will be used for communicating with
         the Event Hubs service. Default is `TransportType.Amqp` in which case port 5671 is used.
         If the port 5671 is unavailable/blocked in the network environment, `TransportType.AmqpOverWebsocket` could
         be used instead which uses port 443 for communication.
        :paramtype transport_type: ~azure.eventhub.TransportType
        :keyword Dict http_proxy: HTTP proxy settings. This must be a dictionary with the following
         keys: `'proxy_hostname'` (str value) and `'proxy_port'` (int value).
         Additionally the following keys may also be present: `'username', 'password'`.
        :keyword custom_endpoint_address: The custom endpoint address to use for establishing a connection to
         the Event Hubs service, allowing network requests to be routed through any application gateways or
         other paths needed for the host environment. Default is None.
         The format would be like "sb://<custom_endpoint_hostname>:<custom_endpoint_port>".
         If port is not specified in the `custom_endpoint_address`, by default port 443 will be used.
        :paramtype custom_endpoint_address: Optional[str]
        :keyword connection_verify: Path to the custom CA_BUNDLE file of the SSL certificate which is used to
         authenticate the identity of the connection endpoint.
         Default is None in which case `certifi.where()` will be used.
        :paramtype connection_verify: Optional[str]
        :keyword uamqp_transport: Whether to use the `uamqp` library as the underlying transport. The default value is
         False and the Pure Python AMQP library will be used as the underlying transport.
