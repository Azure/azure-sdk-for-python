class EventHubConsumerClient(ClientBase):
    """The EventHubConsumerClient class defines a high level interface for
    receiving events from the Azure Event Hubs service.

    The main goal of `EventHubConsumerClient` is to receive events from all partitions of an EventHub with
    load-balancing and checkpointing.

    When multiple `EventHubConsumerClient` instances are running against the same event hub, consumer group and
    checkpointing location, the partitions will be evenly distributed among them.

    To enable load-balancing and persisted checkpoints, checkpoint_store must be set when creating the
    `EventHubConsumerClient`.
    If a checkpoint store is not provided, the checkpoint will be maintained internally in memory.

    An `EventHubConsumerClient` can also receive from a specific partition when you call its method `receive()` or
    `receive_batch()` and specify the partition_id.
    Load-balancing won't work in single-partition mode. But users can still save checkpoints if the checkpoint_store
    is set.

    :param str fully_qualified_namespace: The fully qualified host name for the Event Hubs namespace.
     The namespace format is: `<yournamespace>.servicebus.windows.net`.
    :param str eventhub_name: The path of the specific Event Hub to connect the client to.
    :param str consumer_group: Receive events from the event hub for this consumer group.
    :param credential: The credential object used for authentication which
     implements a particular interface for getting tokens. It accepts
     :class:`EventHubSharedKeyCredential<azure.eventhub.EventHubSharedKeyCredential>`, or credential objects generated
     by the azure-identity library and objects that implement the `get_token(self, *scopes)` method.
    :type credential: ~azure.core.credentials.TokenCredential or ~azure.core.credentials.AzureSasCredential
     or ~azure.core.credentials.AzureNamedKeyCredential
    :keyword bool logging_enable: Whether to output network trace logs to the logger. Default is `False`.
    :keyword float auth_timeout: The time in seconds to wait for a token to be authorized by the service.
     The default value is 60 seconds. If set to 0, no timeout will be enforced from the client.
    :keyword str user_agent: If specified, this will be added in front of the user agent string.
    :keyword int retry_total: The total number of attempts to redo a failed operation when an error occurs.
     Default value is 3. The context of `retry_total` in receiving is special: The `receive` method is implemented
     by a while-loop calling internal receive method in each iteration. In the `receive` case,
     `retry_total` specifies the numbers of retry after error raised by internal receive method in the while-loop.
     If retry attempts are exhausted, the `on_error` callback will be called (if provided) with the error information.
     The failed internal partition consumer will be closed (`on_partition_close` will be called if provided) and
     new internal partition consumer will be created (`on_partition_initialize` will be called if provided) to resume
     receiving.
    :keyword float retry_backoff_factor: A backoff factor to apply between attempts after the second try
     (most errors are resolved immediately by a second try without a delay).
     In fixed mode, retry policy will always sleep for {backoff factor}.
     In 'exponential' mode, retry policy will sleep for: `{backoff factor} * (2 ** ({number of total retries} - 1))`
     seconds. If the backoff_factor is 0.1, then the retry will sleep
     for [0.0s, 0.2s, 0.4s, ...] between retries. The default value is 0.8.
    :keyword float retry_backoff_max: The maximum back off time. Default value is 120 seconds (2 minutes).
    :keyword retry_mode: The delay behavior between retry attempts. Supported values are 'fixed' or 'exponential',
     where default is 'exponential'.
    :paramtype retry_mode: str
    :keyword float idle_timeout: Timeout, in seconds, after which this client will close the underlying connection
     if there is no further activity. By default the value is None, meaning that the client will not shutdown due to
     inactivity unless initiated by the service.
    :keyword transport_type: The type of transport protocol that will be used for communicating with
     the Event Hubs service. Default is `TransportType.Amqp` in which case port 5671 is used.
     If the port 5671 is unavailable/blocked in the network environment, `TransportType.AmqpOverWebsocket` could
     be used instead which uses port 443 for communication.
    :paramtype transport_type: ~azure.eventhub.TransportType
    :keyword Dict http_proxy: HTTP proxy settings. This must be a dictionary with the following
     keys: `'proxy_hostname'` (str value) and `'proxy_port'` (int value).
     Additionally the following keys may also be present: `'username', 'password'`.
    :keyword checkpoint_store: A manager that stores the partition load-balancing and checkpoint data
     when receiving events. The checkpoint store will be used in both cases of receiving from all partitions
     or a single partition. In the latter case load-balancing does not apply.
     If a checkpoint store is not provided, the checkpoint will be maintained internally
     in memory, and the `EventHubConsumerClient` instance will receive events without load-balancing.
    :paramtype checkpoint_store: ~azure.eventhub.CheckpointStore
    :keyword float load_balancing_interval: When load-balancing kicks in. This is the interval, in seconds,
     between two load-balancing evaluations. Default is 10 seconds.
    :keyword float partition_ownership_expiration_interval: A partition ownership will expire after this number
     of seconds. Every load-balancing evaluation will automatically extend the ownership expiration time.
     Default is 6 * load_balancing_interval, i.e. 60 seconds when using the default load_balancing_interval
     of 10 seconds.
    :keyword load_balancing_strategy: When load-balancing kicks in,
     it will use this strategy to claim and balance the partition ownership.
     Use "greedy" or `LoadBalancingStrategy.GREEDY` for the greedy strategy, which, for every
     load-balancing evaluation, will grab as many unclaimed partitions required to balance the load.
     Use "balanced" or `LoadBalancingStrategy.BALANCED` for the balanced strategy, which, for every load-balancing
     evaluation, claims only one partition that is not claimed by other `EventHubConsumerClient`.
     If all partitions of an EventHub are claimed by other `EventHubConsumerClient` and this client has claimed
     too few partitions, this client will steal one partition from other clients for every load-balancing
     evaluation regardless of the load balancing strategy.
     Greedy strategy is used by default.
    :paramtype load_balancing_strategy: str or ~azure.eventhub.LoadBalancingStrategy
    :keyword str custom_endpoint_address: The custom endpoint address to use for establishing a connection to
     the Event Hubs service, allowing network requests to be routed through any application gateways or
     other paths needed for the host environment. Default is None.
     The format would be like "sb://<custom_endpoint_hostname>:<custom_endpoint_port>".
     If port is not specified in the `custom_endpoint_address`, by default port 443 will be used.
    :keyword str connection_verify: Path to the custom CA_BUNDLE file of the SSL certificate which is used to
     authenticate the identity of the connection endpoint.
     Default is None in which case `certifi.where()` will be used.
