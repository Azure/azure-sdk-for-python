# Release History

## 5.4.0b1 (Unreleased)

**New Features**

- Added support for idempotent publishing which is supported by the service to endeavor to reduce the number of duplicate
  events that are published.
  - `EventHubProducerClient` constructor accepts two new parameters for idempotent publishing:
    - `enable_idempotent_partitions`: A boolean value to tell the `EventHubProducerClient` whether to enable idempotency.
    - `partition_configs`: The set of configurations that can be specified to influence publishing behavior
     specific to the configured Event Hub partition.
  - Introduced a new method `get_partition_publishing_properties` on `EventHubProducerClient` to inspect the information
    about the state of publishing for a partition.
  - Introduced a new property `published_sequence_number` on `EventData` to get the publishing sequence number assigned
    to the event at the time it was successfully published.
  - Introduced a new property `starting_published_sequence_number` on `EventDataBatch` to get the publishing sequence 
    number assigned to the first event in the batch at the time the batch was successfully published.
  - Introduced a new class `azure.eventhub.PartitionPublishingConfiguration` which is a set of configurations that can be
    specified to influence the behavior when publishing directly to an Event Hub partition.

**Bug fixes**

- Sending empty `event_data_batch` will be a no-op now instead of raising error.

**Notes**

- Updated uAMQP dependency to 1.2.15.

## 5.3.0 (2021-02-08)

**New Features**

- Added a `parse_connection_string` method which parses a connection string into a properties bag, `EventHubConnectionStringProperties`, containing its component parts.
- The constructor and `from_connection_string` method of `EventHubConsumerClient` and `EventHubProducerClient` now accept two new optional arguments:
  - `custom_endpoint_address` which allows for specifying a custom endpoint to use when communicating with the Event Hubs service,
and is useful when your network does not allow communicating to the standard Event Hubs endpoint.
  - `connection_verify` which allows for specifying the path to the custom CA_BUNDLE file of the SSL certificate which is used to authenticate
the identity of the connection endpoint.

**Notes**

- Updated uAMQP dependency to 1.2.14.

## 5.2.1 (2021-01-11)

**Bug fixes**

- Updated `azure.eventhub.extension.__init__.py` to be compatible with pkgutil-style namespace (PR #13210, thanks @pjachowi).
- Updated uAMQP dependency to 1.2.13
  - Added support for Python 3.9.
  - Fixed bug that macOS was unable to detect network error (#15473).
  - Fixed bug that `uamqp.ReceiveClient` and `uamqp.ReceiveClientAsync` receive messages during connection establishment (#15555).
  - Fixed bug where connection establishment on macOS with Clang 12 triggering unrecognized selector exception (#15567).
  - Fixed bug in accessing message properties triggering segmentation fault when the underlying C bytes are NULL (#15568).

## 5.2.0 (2020-09-08)

**New Features**

- Connection strings used with `from_connection_string` methods now supports using the `SharedAccessSignature` key in leiu of `sharedaccesskey` and `sharedaccesskeyname`, taking the string of the properly constructed token as value.

## 5.2.0b1 (2020-07-06)

**New Features**

- `EventHubConsumerClient` constructor accepts two new parameters for the load balancer.
    - `load_balancing_strategy`, which can be "greedy" or "balanced". 
     With greedy strategy, one execution of load balancing will claim as many partitions as required to balance the load
     whereas with balanced strategy one execution of load balancing will claim at most 1 partition.
    - `partition_ownership_expiration_interval`, which allows you to customize the partition ownership expiration for load balancing.
     A consumer client may lose its owned partitions more often with a smaller expiration interval. But a larger interval
     may result in idle partitions not being claimed for longer time. 
- Added enum class `azure.eventhub.LoadBalancingStrategy` for `load_balancing_strategy`.

## 5.1.0 (2020-05-04)

**New Features**

- `EventHubProducerClient.send_batch` accepts either an `EventDataBatch` or a finite list of `EventData`. #9181

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed a bug that turned `azure.eventhub.EventhubConsumerClient` into an exclusive receiver when it has no checkpoint store. #11181
- Updated uAMQP dependency to 1.2.7.
  - Fixed bug in setting certificate of tlsio on MacOS. #7201
  - Fixed bug that caused segmentation fault in network tracing on MacOS when setting `logging_enable` to `True` in `EventHubConsumerClient` and `EventHubProducerClient`.

## 5.1.0b1 (2020-04-06)

**New Features**

- Added `EventHubConsumerClient.receive_batch()` to receive and process events in batches instead of one by one. #9184
- `EventHubConsumerCliuent.receive()` has a new param `max_wait_time`. 
`on_event` is called every `max_wait_time` when no events are received and `max_wait_time` is not `None` or 0.
- Param event of `PartitionContext.update_checkpoint` is now optional. The last received event is used when param event is not passed in.
- `EventData.system_properties` has added missing properties when consuming messages from IotHub. #10408

## 5.0.1 (2020-03-09)

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed a bug that swallowed errors when receiving events with `azure.eventhub.EventHubConsumerClient`  #9660
- Fixed a bug that caused `get_eventhub_properties`, `get_partition_ids`, and `get_partition_properties` to raise
an error on Azure Stack #9920 

## 5.0.0 (2020-01-13)

**Breaking changes**

    - Default starting position from where `EventHubConsumerClient` should resume receiving after recovering from an error has been re-prioritized.
        - If there is checkpoint, it will resume from the checkpoint.
        - If there is no checkpoint but `starting_position` is provided, it will resume from `starting_posititon`.
        - If there is no checkpoint or `starting_position`, it will resume from the latest position.
- `PartitionContext`
    - `update_checkpoint` would do in-memory checkpoint instead of doing nothing when checkpoint store is not explicitly provided.
        - The in-memory checkpoints would be used for `EventHubConsumerClient` receiving recovering.
- `get_partition_ids`, `get_partition_properties`, `get_eventhub_properties` would raise error in the case of service returning an error status code.
    - `AuthenticationError` would be raised when service returning error code 401.

    - This batch object can then be used in the `send()` method to send all the added events to Event Hubs.
    - This allows publishers to build batches without the possibility of encountering the error around the message size exceeding the supported limit when sending events.
    - It also allows publishers with bandwidth concerns to control the size of each batch published.
- Added new configuration parameters for exponential delay between retry operations.

- Added new error type `OperationTimeoutError` for send operation.
- Introduced a new class `EventProcessor` which replaces the older concept of [Event Processor Host](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-event-processor-host). This early preview is intended to allow users to test the new design using a single instance of `EventProcessor`. The ability to checkpoints to a durable store will be added in future updates.
    - `EventProcessor`: EventProcessor creates and runs consumers for all partitions of the eventhub.
    - `PartitionManager`: PartitionManager defines the interface for getting/claiming ownerships of partitions and updating checkpoints.
    - `PartitionProcessor`: PartitionProcessor defines the interface for processing events.
    - `CheckpointManager`: CheckpointManager takes responsibility for updating checkpoints during events processing.

**Breaking changes**

- `EventProcessorHost` was replaced by `EventProcessor`, please read the new features for details.
- Replaced `max_retries` configuration parameter of the EventHubClient with `retry_total`.
