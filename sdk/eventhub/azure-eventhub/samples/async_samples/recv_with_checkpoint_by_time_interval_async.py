An example to show receiving events from an Event Hub with checkpoint store doing checkpoint
by every fixed time interval asynchronously.
In the `receive` method of `EventHubConsumerClient`:
If no partition id is specified, the checkpoint_store are used for load-balance and checkpoint.
If partition id is specified, the checkpoint_store can only be used for checkpoint.
