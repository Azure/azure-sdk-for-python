# Azure Cognitive Services Health Insights Cancer Profiling client library for Python

[Health Insights](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-health-insights/?branch=release-azure-health-insights) is an Azure Applied AI Service built with the Azure Cognitive Services Framework, that leverages multiple Cognitive Services, Healthcare API services and other Azure resources.

The [Cancer Profiling model][cancer_profiling_docs] receives clinical records of oncology patients and outputs cancer staging, such as clinical stage TNM categories and pathologic stage TNM categories as well as tumor site, histology.



## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later is required to use this package.
- You need an [Azure subscription][azure_sub] to use this package.
- An existing Cognitive Services Health Insights instance.


### Install the package

```bash
python -m pip install azure-healthinsights-cancerprofiling
```

This table shows the relationship between SDK versions and supported API versions of the service:

|SDK version|Supported API version of service |
|-------------|---------------|
|1.0.0b1 | 2023-03-01-preview|


### Authenticate the client

#### Get the endpoint

You can find the endpoint for your Health Insights service resource using the [Azure Portal][azure_portal] or [Azure CLI][azure_cli]


```bash
# Get the endpoint for the Health Insights service resource
az cognitiveservices account show --name "resource-name" --resource-group "resource-group-name" --query "properties.endpoint"
```

#### Get the API Key

You can get the **API Key** from the Health Insights service resource in the Azure Portal.
Alternatively, you can use **Azure CLI** snippet below to get the API key of your resource.

```PowerShell
az cognitiveservices account keys list --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> --name <your-resource-name>
```

#### Create a CancerProfilingClient with an API Key Credential

Once you have the value for the API key, you can pass it as a string into an instance of **AzureKeyCredential**. Use the key as the credential parameter to authenticate the client:

```python
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.healthinsights.cancerprofiling import CancerProfilingClient

credential = AzureKeyCredential("<api_key>")
client = CancerProfilingClient(endpoint="https://<resource-name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/", credential=credential)
```

### Long-Running Operations

Long-running operations are operations which consist of an initial request sent to the service to start an operation,
followed by polling the service at intervals to determine whether the operation has completed or failed, and if it has
succeeded, to get the result.

Methods that support healthcare analysis, custom text analysis, or multiple analyses are modeled as long-running operations.
The client exposes a `begin_<method-name>` method that returns a poller object. Callers should wait
for the operation to complete by calling `result()` on the poller object returned from the `begin_<method-name>` method.
Sample code snippets are provided to illustrate using long-running operations [below](#examples "Examples").

## Key concepts

The Cancer Profiling model allows you to infer cancer attributes such as tumor site, histology, clinical stage TNM categories and pathologic stage TNM categories from unstructured clinical documents.

## Examples

The following section (#cancer-profiling) provides code snippets that demonstrate usage of the CancerProfilingClient

## Troubleshooting

### General

Health Insights Cancer Profiling client library will raise exceptions defined in [Azure Core][azure_core].

### Logging

This library uses the standard [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) library for logging.

Basic information about HTTP sessions (URLs, headers, etc.) is logged at `INFO` level.

Detailed `DEBUG` level logging, including request/response bodies and **unredacted**
headers, can be enabled on the client or per-operation with the `logging_enable` keyword argument.

See full SDK logging documentation with examples [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/python/sdk/azure-sdk-logging).

### Optional Configuration

Optional keyword arguments can be passed in at the client and per-operation level.
The azure-core [reference documentation](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/python/azure-core/latest/azure.core.html) describes available configurations for retries, logging, transport protocols, and more.
