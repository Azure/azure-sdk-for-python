DESCRIPTION:
    Infer key cancer attributes such as tumor site, histology, clinical stage TNM categories and pathologic stage TNM 
    categories from a patient's unstructured clinical documents.
    
    OncoPhenotype model enables cancer registrars and clinical researchers to infer key cancer attributes from 
    unstructured clinical documents along with evidence relevant to those attributes. This model can help reduce the 
    manual time spent combing through large amounts of patient documentation. 


USAGE:
    python sample_infer_cancer_profiling.py

    Set the environment variables with your own values before running the sample:
    1) HEALTHINSIGHTS_KEY - your source from Health Insights API key.
    2) HEALTHINSIGHTS_ENDPOINT - the endpoint to your source Health Insights resource.

                        No crackles, rales, and wheezes. Resonant percussion.
                    PLAN:
                    Will be referred for a chest x-ray.
                    ======================================
                    CXR showed mild nonspecific opacities in right lung base.
                    PLAN:
                    Findings are suggestive of a working diagnosis of pneumonia. The patient is referred to a

                    About 3 months prior to admission, she stated she had SOB and was febrile.

                    She was treated with antibiotics with partial response.
                    6 weeks later a repeat CXR was performed- a few solid dense findings in the right lung.
                    Therefore, she was referred for a PET-CT which demonstrated increased uptake in the right
                    breast, lymph nodes on the right a few areas in the lungs and liver.
                    On biopsy from the lesion in the right breast- triple negative adenocarcinoma. Genetic
                    testing has not been done thus far.
