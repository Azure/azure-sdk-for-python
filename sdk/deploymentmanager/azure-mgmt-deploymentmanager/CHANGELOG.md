**General Breaking Changes**

This version uses a next-generation code generator that might introduce
breaking changes if from some import. In summary, some modules were
incorrectly visible/importable and have been renamed. This fixed several
issues caused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be used in
the first place. DeploymentManagerClient cannot be imported from
azure.mgmt.deploymentmanager.deployment_manager_client anymore (import
from azure.mgmt.deploymentmanager works like before)
DeploymentManagerClientConfiguration import has been moved from
azure.mgmt.deploymentmanager.deployment_manager_client to
azure.mgmt.deploymentmanager A model MyClass from a "models" sub-module
cannot be imported anymore using
azure.mgmt.deploymentmanager.models.my_class (import from
azure.mgmt.deploymentmanager.models works like before) An operation
class MyClassOperations from an operations sub-module cannot be imported
anymore using
azure.mgmt.deploymentmanager.operations.my_class_operations (import
from azure.mgmt.deploymentmanager.operations works like before) Last but
not least, HTTP connection pooling is now enabled by default. You should
always use a client as a context manager, or call close(), or use no
more than one client per process.
