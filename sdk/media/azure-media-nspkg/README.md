# Microsoft Azure SDK for Python

This is the Microsoft Azure Security Services namespace package.

This package is not intended to be installed directly by the end user.

Since version 3.0, this is Python 2 package only, Python 3.x SDKs will use `PEP420 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420/>` as namespace package strategy.

It provides the necessary files for other packages to extend the azure.security namespace.
