## Microsoft Azure SDK for Python
      
This is the Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store Management Client Library.

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the next generation of management APIs
that replace the old Azure Service Management (ASM).

This package has been tested with Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.

For the older Azure Service Management (ASM) libraries, see
[azure-servicemanagement-legacy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-servicemanagement-legacy)
library.

For a more complete set of Azure libraries, see the
[azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).

## Compatibility

**IMPORTANT**: If you have an earlier version of the azure package
(version < 1.0), you should uninstall it before installing this
package.

You can check the version using pip:

``` shell
pip freeze
```

If you see azure==0.11.0 (or any version below 1.0), uninstall it first:

``` shell
