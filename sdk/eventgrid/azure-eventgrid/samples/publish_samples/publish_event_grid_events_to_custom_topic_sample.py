FILE: publish_event_grid_events_to_custom_topic_sample.py
DESCRIPTION:
    These samples demonstrate creating a list of Eventgrid Events and sending them as a list
    to custom topic.
USAGE:
    python publish_event_grid_events_to_custom_topic_sample.py
    Set the environment variables with your own values before running the sample:
    1) EVENTGRID_TOPIC_KEY - The access key of your eventgrid account.
    2) EVENTGRID_TOPIC_ENDPOINT - The topic hostname. Typically it exists in the format
    "https://<YOUR-TOPIC-NAME>.<REGION-NAME>.eventgrid.azure.net/api/events".
