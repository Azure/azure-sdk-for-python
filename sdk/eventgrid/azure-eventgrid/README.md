# Azure Event Grid client library for Python

Azure Event Grid is a fully-managed intelligent event routing service that allows for uniform event consumption using a publish-subscribe model.

[Source code][python-eg-src] | [Package (PyPI)][python-eg-pypi] | [API reference documentation][python-eg-ref-docs]| [Product documentation][python-eg-product-docs] | [Samples][python-eg-samples]| [Changelog][python-eg-changelog]

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
* Python 2.7, or 3.5 or later is required to use this package.
* You must have an [Azure subscription][azure_subscription] and an Event Grid Topic resource to use this package.

### Install the package
Install the Azure Event Grid client library for Python with [pip][pip]:

```bash
pip install azure-eventgrid
```

* An existing Event Grid topic or domain is required. You can create the resource using [Azure Portal][azure_portal_create_EG_resource] or [Azure CLI][azure_cli_link]

If you use Azure CLI, replace `<resource-group-name>` and `<resource-name>` with your own unique names.

#### Create an Event Grid Topic

```
az eventgrid topic --create --location <location> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <resource-name>
```

#### Create an Event Grid Domain

```
az eventgrid domain --create --location <location> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <resource-name>
```

### Authenticate the client
In order to interact with the Event Grid service, you will need to create an instance of a client.
A **topic_hostname** and **credential** are necessary to instantiate the client object.

#### Looking up the endpoint
You can find the topic endpoint within the Event Grid Topic resource on the Azure portal.
The topic hostname is the URL host component of this endpoint. (Everything up-to and including "eventgrid.azure.net".)

#### Create the client with AzureKeyCredential

To use an Access Key as the `credential` parameter,
pass the key as a string into an instance of [AzureKeyCredential][azure-key-credential].

> **Note:** The Access Key may be found in the azure portal in the "Access Keys" menu of the Event Grid Topic resource.  They may also be obtained via the azure CLI, or the `azure-mgmt-eventgrid` library.

```python
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.eventgrid import EventGridPublisherClient

topic_hostname = "https://<name>.<region>.eventgrid.azure.net"
credential = AzureKeyCredential("<access_key>")
eg_publisher_client = EventGridPublisherClient(topic_hostname, credential)
```

> **Note:** A client may also be authenticated via SAS signature, using the `EventGridSharedAccessSignatureCredential`.  A sample demonstrating this, as well as how to generate that signature utilizing `generate_shared_access_signature` is available [here][python-eg-sample-publish-sas-signature].

## Key concepts

Information about the key concepts on Event Grid, see [Concepts in Azure Event Grid][publisher-service-doc]

### Topic
A channel within the EventGrid service to send events.  Must be of CloudEvent or EventGridEvent schema, (decided at creation time) and the corrosponding event type must be used.

### Domain Topic
A domain exists to rout arbitrary named topics within it.  Topics must not exist beforehand if using a domain, topic name can be provided at send time.  Simply provide the domain endpoint at client construction instead of topic endpoint.

### EventGridPublisherClient
`EventGridPublisherClient` provides operations to send event data to topic hostname specified during client initialization.
Either a list or a single instance of CloudEvent/EventGridEvent/CustomEvent can be sent.

### EventGridConsumer
`EventGridConsumer` is used to desrialize an event received.

## Examples

The following sections provide several code snippets covering some of the most common Event Grid tasks, including:

* [Send an Event Grid Event](#send-an-event-grid-event)
* [Send a Cloud Event](#send-a-cloud-event)
* [Send to a Domain](#send-to-a-domain)
* [Consume an eventgrid Event](#consume-an-event-grid-event)
* [Consume a cloud Event](#consume-a-cloud-event)

### Send an Event Grid Event

This example publishes an Event Grid event.
> **Note:** It is important to know if your topic supports Cloud or EventGrid events beforehand, otherwise send() will throw an exception.

```Python
import os
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.eventgrid import EventGridPublisherClient, EventGridEvent

key = os.environ["EG_ACCESS_KEY"]
topic_hostname = os.environ["EG_TOPIC_HOSTNAME"]

event = EventGridEvent(
    subject="Door1",
    data={"team": "azure-sdk"},
    event_type="Azure.Sdk.Demo",
    data_version="2.0"
)

credential = AzureKeyCredential(key)
client = EventGridPublisherClient(topic_hostname, credential)

client.send(event)
# Note: Events may also be sent as a list, e.g: client.send([event])
```

### Send a Cloud Event

This example publishes a Cloud event.
> **Note:** It is important to know if your topic supports Cloud or EventGrid events beforehand, otherwise send() will throw an exception.

```Python
import os
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.eventgrid import EventGridPublisherClient, CloudEvent

key = os.environ["CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY"]
topic_hostname = os.environ["CLOUD_TOPIC_HOSTNAME"]

event = CloudEvent(
    type="Azure.Sdk.Sample",
    source="https://egsample.dev/sampleevent",
    data={"team": "azure-sdk"}
)

credential = AzureKeyCredential(key)
client = EventGridPublisherClient(topic_hostname, credential)

client.send(event)
# Note: Events may also be sent as a list, e.g: client.send([event])
```

### Send to a Domain

This example illustrates sending to a Domain, whereas the earlier samples sent to a Topic.

The primary difference is that for `EventGridEvents` a topic must be defined in the event being sent, such that it can be routed within the Domain.

```Python
import os
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.eventgrid import EventGridPublisherClient, EventGridEvent

key = os.environ["EG_ACCESS_KEY"]
domain_hostname = os.environ["EG_DOMAIN_HOSTNAME"]

event = EventGridEvent(
    subject="Door1",
    data={"team": "azure-sdk"},
    event_type="Azure.Sdk.Demo",
    data_version="2.0",
    topic="test"
)

credential = AzureKeyCredential(key)
client = EventGridPublisherClient(domain_hostname, credential)

client.send(event)
# Note: Events may also be sent as a list, e.g: client.send([event])
```

### Consume an Event Grid Event

This example demonstrates consuming and deserializing an eventgrid event.

```Python
import os
from azure.eventgrid import EventGridConsumer

consumer = EventGridConsumer()

eg_storage_dict = {
    "id":"bbab625-dc56-4b22-abeb-afcc72e5290c",
    "subject":"/blobServices/default/containers/oc2d2817345i200097container/blobs/oc2d2817345i20002296blob",
    "data":{
        "api":"PutBlockList",
    },
    "eventType":"Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated",
    "dataVersion":"2.0",
    "metadataVersion":"1",
    "eventTime":"2020-08-07T02:28:23.867525Z",
    "topic":"/subscriptions/fake-subscription-id/resourceGroups/fake-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.EventGrid/topics/eventgridegsub"
}

deserialized_event = consumer.decode_eventgrid_event(eg_storage_dict)

# both allow access to raw properties as strings
time_string = deserialized_event.event_time
```

### Consume a Cloud Event

This example demonstrates consuming and deserializing a cloud event.

```Python
import os
from azure.eventgrid import EventGridConsumer

consumer = EventGridConsumer()

cloud_storage_dict = {
    "id":"a0517898-9fa4-4e70-b4a3-afda1dd68672",
    "source":"/subscriptions/fake-subscription-id/resourceGroups/fake-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/fake-storage-account",
    "data":{
        "api":"PutBlockList",
    },
    "type":"Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated",
    "time":"2020-08-07T01:11:49.765846Z",
    "specversion":"1.0"
}

deserialized_event = consumer.decode_cloud_event(cloud_storage_dict)

# both allow access to raw properties as strings
time_string = deserialized_event.time
```

## Troubleshooting

- Enable `azure.eventgrid` logger to collect traces from the library.

### General
Event Grid client library will raise exceptions defined in [Azure Core][azure_core_exceptions].

### Logging
This library uses the standard
[logging][python_logging] library for logging.
Basic information about HTTP sessions (URLs, headers, etc.) is logged at INFO
level.

### Optional Configuration

Optional keyword arguments can be passed in at the client and per-operation level.
The azure-core [reference documentation][azure_core_ref_docs]
describes available configurations for retries, logging, transport protocols, and more.

## Next steps

The following section provides several code snippets illustrating common patterns used in the Event Grid Python API.
