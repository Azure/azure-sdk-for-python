## Getting started

### Prerequisites

To use this package, you must have:
- Azure subscription - [Create a free account][azure_subscription]
- AgriFood (FarmBeats) resource - [Install FarmBeats][install_farmbeats]
- Python 2.7, 3.6 or later - [Install Python][python]

### Install the package

Install the Azure AgriFood Farming client library for Python with [pip][pip]:

```bash
pip install azure-agrifood-farming
```

### Authenticate the client

To use an [Azure Active Directory (AAD) token credential][authenticate_with_token],
provide an instance of the desired credential type obtained from the
[azure-identity][azure_identity_credentials] library.

To authenticate with AAD, you must first [pip][pip] install [`azure-identity`][azure_identity_pip] and
enable AAD authentication on your AgriFood resource (ADD LINK).

After setup, you can choose which type of [credential][azure_identity_credentials] from azure.identity to use.
As an example, [DefaultAzureCredential][default_azure_credential]
can be used to authenticate the client:

Set the values of the client ID, tenant ID, and client secret of the AAD application as environment variables:
AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET

Use the returned token credential to authenticate the client:

```python
from azure.agrifood.farming import FarmBeatsClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = FarmBeatsClient(endpoint="https://<my-account-name>.farmbeats.azure.net", credential=credential)
```

## Key concepts
Basic understanding of below terms will help to get started with FarmBeats client library.

### [Farm Hierarchy][farm_hierarchy]
Farm hierarchy is a collection of below entities.
- Farmer - is the custodian of all the agronomic data.
- Farm - is a logical collection of fields and/or seasonal fields. They do not have any area associated with them.
- Field - is a multi-polygon area. This is expected to be stable across seasons.
- Seasonal field - is a multi-polygon area. To define a seasonal boundary we need the details of area (boundary), time (season) and crop. New seasonal fields are expected to be created for every growing season.
- Boundary - is the actual multi-polygon area expressed as a geometry (in geojson). It is normally associated with a field or a seasonal field. Satellite, weather and farm operations data is linked to a boundary.
- Cascade delete - Agronomic data is stored hierarchically with farmer as the root. The hierarchy includes Farmer -> Farms -> Fields -> Seasonal Fields -> Boundaries -> Associated data (satellite, weather, farm operations). Cascade delete refers to the process of deleting any node and its subtree. 
    
### [Scenes][scenes]
Scenes refers to images normally ingested using satellite APIs. This includes raw bands and derived bands (Ex: NDVI). Scenes may also include spatial outputs of an inference or AI/ML model (Ex: LAI).

### [Farm Operations][farm_operations_docs]
Fam operations includes details pertaining to tilling, planting, application of pesticides & nutrients, and harvesting. This can either be manually pushed into FarmBeats using APIs or the same information can be pulled from farm equipment service providers like John Deere. 


## Examples

### Create a Farmer
Once you have authenticated and created the client object as shown in the [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client) 
section, you can create a farmer within the FarmBeats resource like this:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.agrifood.farming import FarmBeatsClient
from azure.agrifood.farming.models import Farmer

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = FarmBeatsClient(endpoint="https://<my-account-name>.farmbeats.azure.net", credential=credential)

farmer = client.farmers.create_or_update(
    farmer_id="farmer-1",
    farmer=Farmer(
        name="Contoso Farmer",
        description="Your custom farmer description here",
        status="Active",
        properties={
            "your-custom-key": "queryable value",
        }
    )
)
```

### Create a Farm


```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.agrifood.farming import FarmBeatsClient
from azure.agrifood.farming.models import Farm

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = FarmBeatsClient(endpoint="https://<my-account-name>.farmbeats.azure.net", credential=credential)

farmer_id = "farmer-1" # Using farmer from previous example

farm = client.farms.create_or_update(
    farmer_id=farmer_id,
    farm_id="farm-1",
    farm=Farm(
        name="Contoso Westlake Farm",
        properties={
            "location": "Westlake",
            "country": "USA"
        }
    )
)
```

### Create a Season

Creating a Season object, spanning from April to August of 2021.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.agrifood.farming import FarmBeatsClient
from azure.agrifood.farming.models import Season

from isodate.tzinfo import Utc
from datetime import datetime

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = FarmBeatsClient(endpoint="https://<my-account-name>.farmbeats.azure.net", credential=credential)

season = client.seasons.create_or_update(
    season_id="season-summer-2021",
    season=Season(
        start_date_time=datetime(2021, 4, 1, tzinfo=Utc()),
        end_date_time=datetime(2021, 8, 31, tzinfo=Utc()),
        name="Summer of 2021",
        year=2021
    )
)
```

### Create a Seasonal Field

In this example, we create a Seasonal Field, using the Season and Field objects
created in the preceding examples.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.agrifood.farming import FarmBeatsClient
from azure.agrifood.farming.models import SeasonalField

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = FarmBeatsClient(endpoint="https://<my-account-name>.farmbeats.azure.net", credential=credential)

farmer_id = "farmer-1"
farm_id = "farm-1"
season_id = "season-summer-2021"

seasonal_field = client.seasonal_fields.create_or_update(
    farmer_id=farmer_id,
    seasonal_field_id="westlake-summer-2021",
    seasonal_field=SeasonalField(
        farm_id=farm_id,
        season_id=season_id
    )
)
```

### Create a Boundary

Creating a Boundary for the Seasonal Field created in the preceding example.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.agrifood.farming import FarmBeatsClient
from azure.agrifood.farming.models import Boundary, Polygon

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = FarmBeatsClient(endpoint="https://<my-account-name>.farmbeats.azure.net", credential=credential)

farmer_id = "farmer-1"
seasonal_field_id = "westlake-summer-2021"

boundary = client.boundaries.create_or_update(
    farmer_id=farmer_id,
    boundary_id="westlake-boundary-1",
    boundary=Boundary(
        parent_id=seasonal_field_id,
        geometry=Polygon(
            coordinates=[
                [
                    [73.70457172393799, 20.545385304358106],
                    [73.70457172393799, 20.545385304358106],
                    [73.70448589324951, 20.542411534243367],
                    [73.70877742767334, 20.541688176010233],
                    [73.71023654937744, 20.545083911372505],
                    [73.70663166046143, 20.546992723579137],
                    [73.70457172393799, 20.545385304358106],
                ]
            ]
        )
    )
)
```

### Ingest Satellite Imagery

Triggering a Satellite Data Ingestion job for the boundary created above,
to ingest Leaf Area Index data for the month of January 2020.
This is a Long Running Operation (also called a 'Job'), and returns
a Poller object. Calling the `.result()` method on the poller object
waits for the operation to terminate, and returns the final status.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.agrifood.farming import FarmBeatsClient
from azure.agrifood.farming.models import SatelliteDataIngestionJob, SatelliteData

from isodate.tzinfo import Utc
from datetime import datetime

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = FarmBeatsClient(endpoint="https://<my-account-name>.farmbeats.azure.net", credential=credential)

farmer_id = "farmer-1"
boundary_id = "westlake-boundary-1"

# Queue the job
satellite_job_poller = client.scenes.begin_create_satellite_data_ingestion_job(
    job_id="westlake-boundary-1-lai-jan2020",
    job=SatelliteDataIngestionJob(
        farmer_id=farmer_id,
        boundary_id=boundary_id,
        start_date_time=datetime(2020, 1, 1, tzinfo=Utc()),
        end_date_time=datetime(2020, 1, 31, tzinfo=Utc()),
        data=SatelliteData(
            image_names=[
                "LAI"
            ]
        )
    )
)

# Wait for the job to terminate
satellite_job = satellite_job_poller.result()
```

### Get Ingested Satellite Scenes

Querying for the scenes created by the job in the previous example.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.agrifood.farming import FarmBeatsClient

from datetime import datetime

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = FarmBeatsClient(endpoint="https://<my-account-name>.farmbeats.azure.net", credential=credential)

farmer_id = "farmer-1"
boundary_id = "westlake-boundary-1"

scenes = client.scenes.list(
    farmer_id=farmer_id,
    boundary_id=boundary_id,
    start_date_time=datetime(2020, 1, 1, tzinfo=Utc()),
    end_date_time=datetime(2020, 1, 31, tzinfo=Utc()),
)

for scene in scenes:
    bands = [image_file.name for image_file in scene.image_files]
    bands_str = ", ".join(bands)
    print(f"Scene at {scene.scene_date_time} has the bands {bands_str}")
```

## Troubleshooting

### General

The AgriFood Farming client will raise exceptions defined in [Azure Core][azure_core] if you call `.raise_for_status()` on your responses.

### Logging

This library uses the standard
[logging][python_logging] library for logging.
Basic information about HTTP sessions (URLs, headers, etc.) is logged at INFO
level.

Detailed DEBUG level logging, including request/response bodies and unredacted
headers, can be enabled on a client with the `logging_enable` keyword argument:

```python
import sys
import logging
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.agrifood.farming import FarmBeatsClient

# Create a logger for the 'azure' SDK
logger = logging.getLogger('azure')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Configure a console output
handler = logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout)
logger.addHandler(handler)

endpoint = "https://<my-account-name>.farmbeats.azure.net"
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# This client will log detailed information about its HTTP sessions, at DEBUG level
client = FarmBeatsClient(endpoint=endpoint, credential=credential, logging_enable=True)
```

Similarly, `logging_enable` can enable detailed logging for a single call,
even when it isn't enabled for the client:

```python
client.crops.get(crop_id="crop_id", logging_enable=True)
```
