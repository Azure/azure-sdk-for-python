DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates creation of the complete farm hierarchy
    - Creation of Farmer
    - Creation of Farm
    - Creation of Field
    - Creation of Crop and Crop Variety
    - Creation of Season and SeasonalField
    - Creation of Boundary with a multipolygon GeoJSON

USAGE:
    ```python sample_farm_hierarchy_complete.py```

    Set the environment variables with your own values before running the sample:
    - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
    - `FARMBEATS_ENDPOINT`
