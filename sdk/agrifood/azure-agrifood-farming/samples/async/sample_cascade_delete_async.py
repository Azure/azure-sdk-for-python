DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates 
    - Getting a filterd list of farmers based on last modified timestamp
    - Queuing a cascade delete job on a farmer, and polling for it to complete

USAGE:
    ```python sample_cascade_delete_async.py```

    Set the environment variables with your own values before running the sample:
    - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
    - `FARMBEATS_ENDPOINT`
