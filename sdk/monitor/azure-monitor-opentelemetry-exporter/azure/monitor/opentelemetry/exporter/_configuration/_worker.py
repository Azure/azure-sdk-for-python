    This class manages a daemon background thread that periodically fetches configuration

    The worker operates independently once started and handles all configuration refresh
    operations in the background, including error handling and dynamic interval adjustment.

        _default_refresh_interval (int): Default refresh interval (3600 seconds/1 hour)

        _state_lock (threading.Lock): Thread lock for worker state management

        _refresh_thread (threading.Thread): Background daemon thread for configuration refresh
        _refresh_interval (int): Current refresh interval in seconds

            - Uses _shutdown_event.wait() for interruptible sleep periods
            - Exits cleanly when shutdown is requested
