FILE: sample_upload_file_contents.py

DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates how to upload the contents of a file to a Log Analytics workspace. The file is
    expected to contain a list of JSON objects.

    Note: This sample requires the azure-identity library.

USAGE:
    python sample_upload_file_contents.py

    Set the environment variables with your own values before running the sample:
    1) DATA_COLLECTION_ENDPOINT - your data collection endpoint
    2) LOGS_DCR_RULE_ID - your data collection rule immutable ID
    3) LOGS_DCR_STREAM_NAME - your data collection rule stream name

    If using an application service principal for authentication, set the following:
    1) AZURE_TENANT_ID - your Azure AD tenant (directory) ID
    2) AZURE_CLIENT_ID - your Azure AD client (application) ID
    3) AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET - your Azure AD client secret
