## 1.0.0b1 (2021-06-10)

  **Features**
  - Version (1.0.0b1) is the first preview of our efforts to create a user-friendly and Pythonic client library for Azure Monitor Query.
  For more information about this, and preview releases of other Azure SDK libraries, please visit https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/python.html.
  - Added `~azure.monitor.query.LogsQueryClient` to query log analytics along with `~azure.monitor.query.aio.LogsQueryClient`.
  - Implements the `~azure.monitor.query.MetricsQueryClient` for querying metrics, listing namespaces and metric definitions along with `~azure.monitor.query.aio.MetricsQueryClient`.
