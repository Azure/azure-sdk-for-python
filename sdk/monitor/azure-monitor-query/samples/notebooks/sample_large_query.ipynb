    "# Query with large result sets\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample notebook demonstrates how to query large amounts of data using the Azure Monitor Query client library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to Log Analytics [service limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/service-limits#la-query-api), sometimes it may not be possible to retrieve all the expected data in a single query. For example, the number of rows returned or the maximum size of the data returned may exceed the stated limits. One approach for overcoming these limits is to split the queries into multiple smaller queries using different time ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how your data in a Log Analytics workspace can first be queried to determine the time ranges that can be used to split the data retrieval into multiple smaller queries without exceeding the service limits. Then, you will asynchronously execute the smaller queries and combine the results into a single pandas DataFrame which can be used for further analysis. Afterwards, this notebook also shows how to export the data to an [Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction) account.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer**: This approach of splitting data retrieval into multiple smaller queries is good when dealing with a few GB or a few millions of records per hour. For larger data sets, [exporting](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export) is recommended."

When constructing this query, the recommendation is to use [reduced KQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/logs/basic-logs-query?tabs=portal-1#kql-language-limits) which are optimized for data retrieval. To get all rows/columns, just set `QUERY = <name-of-table>`. \n",

    "- `DAYS_BACK` - The number of days to go back from the end time. For example, if `END_TIME = datetime.now()` and `DAYS_BACK = 7`, the query will return data from the last 7 days. Note that fetched data will (initially) be stored in memory on your system, so it is possible to run into memory limitations if the query returns a large amount of data. If this issue is encountered, consider querying the data in time segments. For example, instead of querying 365 days of data at once, query 100 days of data at a time by setting the values of `END_TIME` and `DAYS_BACK` appropriately and re-running the notebook from this cell onwards for each separate segment.\n",
    "- `MAX_ROWS_PER_QUERY` - The max number of rows that is returned from a single query. This is defaulted to the service limit of 500,000 rows multiplied by some factor to allow for some wiggle room. This limit may sometimes be exceeded if many entries share the same timestamp.\n",
    "- `MAX_BYTES_PER_QUERY` - The max size in bytes of data returned from a single query. This is defaulted to the service limit of 100 MiB multiplied by some factor to allow for some wiggle room.\n",
    "- `MAX_CONCURRENT_QUERIES` - The max number of concurrent queries to run at once. This is defaulted to 5. Reducing this can help avoid errors due to rate limits."
