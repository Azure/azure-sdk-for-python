## Microsoft Azure SDK for Python

This is the Microsoft Azure DNS Management Client Library.

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the next generation of management APIs
that replace the old Azure Service Management (ASM).

This package has been tested with Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.

For the older Azure Service Management (ASM) libraries, see
[azure-servicemanagement-legacy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-servicemanagement-legacy)

For a more complete set of Azure libraries, see the
[azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).
