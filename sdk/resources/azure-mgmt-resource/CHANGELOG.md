## 15.0.0b1 (2020-06-17)

This is beta preview version.

This version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).

**General breaking changes**

- Credential system has been completly revamped:

  - `azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/
  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`

- The `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. Example: `MyClient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=True)`. For a complete set of
  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)
- You can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead
- Operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.LROPoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.LROPoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.
- Exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.HttpResponseError` (`CloudError` has been removed).
- Most of the operation kwarg have changed. Some of the most noticeable:

  - `raw` has been removed. Equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal HTTP response for advanced user
  - For a complete set of
  supported options, see the [parameters accept in Request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)

**General new features**

- Type annotations support using `typing`. SDKs are mypy ready.
- This client has now stable and official support for async. Check the `aio` namespace of your package to find the async client.
- This client now support natively tracing library like OpenCensus or OpenTelemetry. See this [tracing quickstart](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/core/azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry) for an overview.

  - Policy default API version is now 2018-05-01

**General Breaking changes**

This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might*
introduce breaking changes if you were importing from the v20xx_yy_zz
API folders. In summary, some modules were incorrectly
visible/importable and have been renamed. This fixed several issues
caused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be used in the
first place.

The following applies for all client and namespaces, we take
ResourceManagementClient and "resources" as example: -
ResourceManagementClient cannot be imported from
`azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz.resource_management_client`
anymore (import from `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz`
works like before) - ResourceManagementClientConfiguration import has
been moved from
`azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz.resource_management_client`
to `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz` - A model `MyClass`
from a "models" sub-module cannot be imported anymore using
`azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz.models.my_class` (import
from `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz.models` works like
before) - An operation class `MyClassOperations` from an
`operations` sub-module cannot be imported anymore using
`azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz.operations.my_class_operations`
(import from `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz.operations`
works like before)

Last but not least, HTTP connection pooling is now enabled by default.
You should always use a client as a context manager, or call close(), or
use no more than one client per process.

    HTTP session open for performance

## 2.0.0rc1 (2018-04-23)

**General Breaking changes**

This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might*
introduce breaking changes.

  - Model signatures now use only keyword-argument syntax. All
    positional arguments must be re-written as keyword-arguments. To
    keep auto-completion in most cases, models are now generated for
    Python 2 and Python 3. Python 3 uses the "*" syntax for
    keyword-only arguments.
  - Enum types now use the "str" mixin (class AzureEnum(str, Enum)) to
    improve the behavior when unrecognized enum values are encountered.
    While this is not a breaking change, the distinctions are important,
    and are documented here:
    <https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#others> At a glance:
      - "is" should not be used at all.
      - "format" will return the string value, where "%s" string
        formatting will return `NameOfEnum.stringvalue`. Format syntax
        should be prefered.
  - New Long Running Operation:
      - Return type changes from
        `msrestazure.azure_operation.AzureOperationPoller` to
        `msrest.polling.LROPoller`. External API is the same.
      - Return type is now **always** a `msrest.polling.LROPoller`,
        regardless of the optional parameters used.
      - The behavior has changed when using `raw=True`. Instead of
        returning the initial call result as `ClientRawResponse`,
        without polling, now this returns an LROPoller. After polling,
        the final resource will be returned as a `ClientRawResponse`.
      - New `polling` parameter. The default behavior is
        `Polling=True` which will poll using ARM algorithm. When
        `Polling=False`, the response of the initial call will be
        returned without polling.
      - `polling` parameter accepts instances of subclasses of
        `msrest.polling.PollingMethod`.
      - `add_done_callback` will no longer raise if called after
        polling is finished, but will instead execute the callback right
        away.

**Features**

  - Add new ApiVersion 2018-02-01 (new default):
      - Add on_error_deployment
      - Support MSI in generic ARM resources
  - All clients now support Azure profiles.

        group

**Bug fixes**

**Breaking changes to preview clients**

  - Major renaming into ManagedApplication client, and GA ApiVersion
    2017-09-01

**Disclaimer**

  - We removed the "filter" parameter of policy_definitions.list
    method. However, we don't upgrade the major version of the package,
    since this parameter has no meaning for the RestAPI and there is no
    way any Python users would have been able to use it anyway.

## 1.1.0 (2017-05-15)

  - Tag 1.1.0rc2 as stable (same content)

**Bug fixes**

  - Subscriptions: Removed deprecated tenant ID
  - Managed Applications: All list methods return an iterator

**New Resources ApiVersion 2017-05-10**

  - Deploy resources to multiple resource groups from one template

  - Some breaking changes are introduced compared to previous versions:
    
    >   - deployments.list has been renamed
    >     deployments.list_by_resource_group
    >   - resource_groups.list_resources has been moved to
    >     resources.list_by_resource_group
    >   - resource_groups.patch has been renamed to
    >     resource_groups.update and now takes an instance of
    >     ResourceGroupPatchable (and not ResourceGroup).

The default is still 2016-09-01 in this package, waiting for the
ApiVersion to be widely available.
