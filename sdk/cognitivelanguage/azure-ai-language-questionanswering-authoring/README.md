# Azure AI Language Question Answering Authoring client library for Python

This package provides **authoring / management operations** for Azure AI Language Question Answering as a **standalone** package, separated from the runtime Q&A client (`azure-ai-language-questionanswering`). It lets you create, update, import/export, and deploy Question Answering projects and manage sources, QnAs, and synonyms.

> NOTE: This is an initial preview (`1.0.0b1`) and includes support for a preview service API version. Surface may change before GA.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- An Azure subscription
- An Azure AI Language resource with Question Answering enabled

### Install the package

```bash
python -m pip install azure-ai-language-questionanswering-authoring
```

#### Prequisites

- Python 3.9 or later is required to use this package.
- You need an [Azure subscription][azure_sub] to use this package.
- An existing Azure Ai Language Questionanswering Authoring instance.

```

### Create a client
```python
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.ai.language.questionanswering.authoring import QuestionAnsweringAuthoringClient

endpoint = "https://<resource-name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com"
credential = AzureKeyCredential("<api-key>")
client = QuestionAnsweringAuthoringClient(endpoint, credential)
```

### List projects
```python
for proj in client.list_projects():
	print(proj.name, proj.last_modified_date)
```

### Create or update a project (simplified example)
```python
body = {"language": "en", "description": "FAQ project"}
client.create_project(project_name="FAQ", body=body)
```

### Export project (long-running operation)
```python
poller = client.begin_export(project_name="FAQ", format="json")
export = poller.result()
print(export.status)
```

### Authentication
This client supports either `AzureKeyCredential` (with an API key) or Azure Active Directory credentials (e.g. `DefaultAzureCredential`). For AAD you must use a custom subâ€‘domain endpoint (not the regional shared endpoint).

### Versioning
The client targets the latest GA API plus preview version `2025-05-15-preview` defined in the accompanying TypeSpec. Preview operations may change.

### Logging
Enable `azure.core` logging for diagnostics:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
```
