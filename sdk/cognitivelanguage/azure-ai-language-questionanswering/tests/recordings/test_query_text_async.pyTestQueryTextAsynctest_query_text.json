While the Nvidia GeForce MX250 GPU isn't meant for demanding gaming, it is a step up from integrated graphics as proven by comparing it to the UHD 620 GPU in the FHD model.   The MX250-equipped Envy 13 scored a 116,575 on the Ice Storm Unlimited benchmark while the base model scored a 82,270. Upgrading to the discrete graphics gives the Envy 13 better performance than the Notebook 9 Pro (61,662; UHD 620), Surface Laptop 2 (71,647; UHD 620) and the premium laptop average (86,937).

We played the racing game Dirt 3 at 92 frames per second on the MX250 model, which is well above our 30-fps playability, the category average (69 fps) and what the Surface Laptop 2 (82 fps) achieved.
