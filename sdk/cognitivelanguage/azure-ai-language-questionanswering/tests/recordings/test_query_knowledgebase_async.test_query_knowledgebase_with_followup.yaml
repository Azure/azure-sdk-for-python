        and provides plenty of additional power to charge connected USB devices.\\n\\nHere's
        how to set up your Surface Dock:\\n\\n1.  Plug the AC end of the Surface Dock
        power cord into an electrical outlet or power strip and plug the other end
        into the power port on your Surface Dock.\\n2.  If you want to use a wired
        network connection, connect a network cable to the Ethernet port on your Surface
        Dock.\\n3.  Connect your computer peripherals to the USB ports on your Surface
        Dock.\\n4.  Connect a cable from your monitor to a Mini DisplayPort on your
        Surface Dock.If your monitor cable doesn\u2019t have a Mini DisplayPort connector,
        you\u2019ll need to buy another cable or an adapter. For more info on adapters,
