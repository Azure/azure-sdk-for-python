            "answer": "**Set up your workspace with Surface Dock**\n\nSurface Dock supports high-speed transfer of video, audio, and data. Its compact design gives you flexibility and keeps your desktop clutter-free. The external power supply recharges your Surface and provides plenty of additional power to charge connected USB devices.\n\nHere\u0027s how to set up your Surface Dock:\n\n1.  Plug the AC end of the Surface Dock power cord into an electrical outlet or power strip and plug the other end into the power port on your Surface Dock.\n2.  If you want to use a wired network connection, connect a network cable to the Ethernet port on your Surface Dock.\n3.  Connect your computer peripherals to the USB ports on your Surface Dock.\n4.  Connect a cable from your monitor to a Mini DisplayPort on your Surface Dock.If your monitor cable doesn\u2019t have a Mini DisplayPort connector, you\u2019ll need to buy another cable or an adapter. For more info on adapters, see [Connect Surface to a TV, monitor, or](http://www.microsoft.com/surface/support/music-photos-and-video/connect-surface-to-a-tv-display-or-projector) [projector](http://www.microsoft.com/surface/support/music-photos-and-video/connect-surface-to-a-tv-display-or-projector) on Surface.com.\n5.  Connect any audio accessories like speakers or headphones.Without external speakers, you may not hear audio when you\u2019re using your Surface.
