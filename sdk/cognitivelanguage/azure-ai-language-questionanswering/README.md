# Azure AI Language Question Answering client library for Python

Question Answering is an Azure AI Language capability that lets you build a conversational, question‑and‑answer layer over your existing data. It extracts question/answer pairs from semi‑structured content (FAQ pages, manuals, documents) and uses them to answer user questions with the most relevant answer automatically.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9 or later.
* An [Azure subscription][azure_subscription].
* An Azure [Language resource][language_service] (with a custom domain endpoint if you plan to use Azure Active Directory authentication).

### Install the package

Install the Azure Question Answering client library for Python with [pip][pip_link]:

```bash
python -m pip install azure-ai-language-questionanswering
```

> This version of the client library targets the service REST API version `2025-05-15-preview`.

### Authenticate the client

In order to interact with the Question Answering service, you'll create an instance of the [QuestionAnsweringClient][questionanswering_client_class] (or the [AuthoringClient][authoring_client_class] in the separate authoring package). The **recommended** approach is to use Azure Active Directory via `DefaultAzureCredential` from the [azure-identity][azure_identity_credentials] library. This avoids embedding keys, enables managed identity in production, and unifies authentication across Azure SDKs.

> Important: To use Azure AD (AAD) you must use your resource's **custom subdomain** endpoint (for example: `https://<my-subdomain>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/`); legacy regional generic endpoints (e.g., `https://eastus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com`) do **not** support AAD token authentication.

#### Recommended: DefaultAzureCredential

Prerequisites for AAD authentication:

* [Install azure-identity][install_azure_identity]
* [Register an AAD application][register_aad_app]
* [Grant access][grant_role_access] to the Language resource (e.g., assign the "Cognitive Services Language Reader" role, plus writer roles if needed for authoring)

Set these environment variables only if you’re using a service principal with a client secret (otherwise, if you rely on Azure CLI / VS Code login or Managed Identity, you can skip this step):
AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET

Then create the client:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.language.questionanswering import QuestionAnsweringClient

endpoint = "https://<my-subdomain>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/"  # custom subdomain endpoint
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

client = QuestionAnsweringClient(endpoint, credential)
```

Authoring (if using the separate authoring package):

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.language.questionanswering.authoring import AuthoringClient

endpoint = "https://<my-subdomain>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/"
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

authoring_client = AuthoringClient(endpoint, credential)
```

#### Alternative: API key credential

For quick starts or scripts where you have not yet configured AAD, you can use an API key with `AzureKeyCredential`. You can obtain the key from the Azure Portal, or via the CLI:

```powershell
az cognitiveservices account keys list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <resource-name>
```

Then:

```python
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.ai.language.questionanswering import QuestionAnsweringClient

endpoint = "https://<my-account>.cognitiveservices.azure.com"  # regional or custom subdomain
credential = AzureKeyCredential("<api-key>")

client = QuestionAnsweringClient(endpoint, credential)
```

> Note: You can seamlessly switch between key and AAD auth — no code changes beyond the credential object.

**Why DefaultAzureCredential?**

* Eliminates hard‑coded secrets
* Works locally (developer tools), in CI (service principal / federated), and in production (Managed Identity)
* Centralizes token acquisition & caching
* Supports future auth enhancements without code changes

## Key concepts

### QuestionAnsweringClient

The [QuestionAnsweringClient][questionanswering_client_class] is the primary interface for asking questions using a knowledge base with your own information, or text input using pre-trained models.
For asynchronous operations, an async `QuestionAnsweringClient` is in the `azure.ai.language.questionanswering.aio` namespace.

> Authoring (project creation, knowledge source management, deployment) has moved to a separate package and is intentionally not covered in this runtime client README.

## Examples

### QuestionAnsweringClient usage examples

The `azure-ai-language-questionanswering` client library provides both synchronous and asynchronous APIs.

* [Ask a question](#ask-a-question-options-object)
* [Ask a follow-up question](#follow-up-question-options-object)
* [Asynchronous operations](#async-usage-options-object)

#### Ask a question (options object)

The only input required to ask a question using a knowledge base is just the question itself:

```python
import os
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.language.questionanswering import QuestionAnsweringClient
from azure.ai.language.questionanswering.models import AnswersOptions

endpoint = os.environ["AZURE_QUESTIONANSWERING_ENDPOINT"]  # must be a custom subdomain for AAD
client = QuestionAnsweringClient(endpoint, DefaultAzureCredential())

options = AnswersOptions(
    question="How long should my Surface battery last?",
    # Optional extra parameters:
    # confidence_threshold=0.2,
    # top=5,
    # short_answer_options=qna.ShortAnswerOptions(top=1)
)
response = client.get_answers(options, project_name="FAQ", deployment_name="production")

for answer in response.answers:
    print(f"({answer.confidence:.2f}) {answer.answer}")
    print(f"Source: {answer.source}")
```

You can also pass optional parameters like `confidence_threshold`, `top`, or `short_answer_options` inside the `AnswersOptions` object.

#### Ask a question (flattened)

For convenience, you can also call `get_answers` directly with keyword parameters:

```python
# Equivalent flattened form - same result as above
response = client.get_answers(
    question="How long should my Surface battery last?",
    project_name="FAQ",
    deployment_name="production",
    # Optional parameters can be passed directly:
    # confidence_threshold=0.2,
    # top=5
)

for answer in response.answers:
    print(f"({answer.confidence:.2f}) {answer.answer}")
    print(f"Source: {answer.source}")
```

#### Follow-up question (options object)

If your knowledge base is configured for [chit-chat][questionanswering_docs_chat], the answers from the knowledge base may include suggested [prompts for follow-up questions][questionanswering_refdocs_prompts] to initiate a conversation. You can ask a follow-up question by providing the ID of your chosen answer as the context for the continued conversation:

```python
from azure.ai.language.questionanswering.models import AnswersOptions, KnowledgeBaseAnswerContext

follow_up_options = AnswersOptions(
    question="How long should charging take?",
    answer_context=KnowledgeBaseAnswerContext(previous_qna_id=previous_answer.qna_id),
)
follow_up = client.get_answers(follow_up_options, project_name="FAQ", deployment_name="production")

for answer in follow_up.answers:
    print(f"({answer.confidence:.2f}) {answer.answer}")
```

#### Follow-up question (flattened)

```python
import os
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.language.questionanswering import QuestionAnsweringClient
from azure.ai.language.questionanswering.models import KnowledgeBaseAnswerContext

endpoint = os.environ["AZURE_QUESTIONANSWERING_ENDPOINT"]
client = QuestionAnsweringClient(endpoint, DefaultAzureCredential())

output = client.get_answers(
    question="How long should charging take?",
    answer_context=KnowledgeBaseAnswerContext(previous_qna_id=previous_answer.qna_id),
    project_name="FAQ",
    deployment_name="production"
)
for candidate in output.answers:
    print(f"({candidate.confidence}) {candidate.answer}")
    print(f"Source: {candidate.source}")
```

#### Async usage (options object)

The above examples can also be run asynchronously using the clients in the `aio` namespace:

```python
import os
import asyncio
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.language.questionanswering.aio import QuestionAnsweringClient
from azure.ai.language.questionanswering.models import AnswersOptions

async def main():
    endpoint = os.environ["AZURE_QUESTIONANSWERING_ENDPOINT"]
    client = QuestionAnsweringClient(endpoint, DefaultAzureCredential())
    options = AnswersOptions(question="How long should my Surface battery last?")
    response = await client.get_answers(options, project_name="FAQ", deployment_name="production")
    for answer in response.answers:
        print(f"({answer.confidence:.2f}) {answer.answer}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Async usage (flattened)

```python
import os
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.language.questionanswering.aio import QuestionAnsweringClient

endpoint = os.environ["AZURE_QUESTIONANSWERING_ENDPOINT"]
client = QuestionAnsweringClient(endpoint, DefaultAzureCredential())

output = await client.get_answers(
    question="How long should my Surface battery last?",
    project_name="FAQ",
    deployment_name="production"
)
```

## Optional Configuration

Optional keyword arguments can be passed in at the client and per-operation level. The azure-core [reference documentation][azure_core_ref_docs] describes available configurations for retries, logging, transport protocols, and more.

## Troubleshooting

### General

Azure Question Answering clients raise exceptions defined in [Azure Core][azure_core_readme].
When you interact with the Cognitive Language Service Question Answering client library using the Python SDK, errors returned by the service correspond to the same HTTP status codes returned for [REST API][questionanswering_rest_docs] requests.

For example, if you submit a question to a non-existent knowledge base, a `400` error is returned indicating "Bad Request".

```python
from azure.core.exceptions import HttpResponseError

try:
    client.get_answers(
        question="Why?",
        project_name="invalid-knowledge-base",
        deployment_name="production"
    )
except HttpResponseError as error:
    print("Query failed: {}".format(error.message))
```

### Logging

This library uses the standard
[logging][python_logging] library for logging.
Basic information about HTTP sessions (URLs, headers, etc.) is logged at INFO
level.

Detailed DEBUG level logging, including request/response bodies and unredacted
headers, can be enabled on a client with the `logging_enable` argument.

See the full SDK logging documentation with examples in the [logging guidance][sdk_logging_docs].

## API Usage Notes

This library supports both explicit options objects (like `AnswersOptions` for `get_answers` and `AnswersFromTextOptions` for `get_answers_from_text`) and flattened keyword parameters for convenience. Both approaches are fully supported and equivalent (and work regardless of whether you use `DefaultAzureCredential` or an API key):

* **Options object approach**: `client.get_answers(AnswersOptions(question="...", top=5), project_name="...", deployment_name="...")`
* **Flattened parameters**: `client.get_answers(question="...", top=5, project_name="...", deployment_name="...")`

Choose whichever style best fits your coding preferences - both produce identical results.
