# Samples for Language QuestionAnswering client library for Python

Question Answering is a cloud-based API service that lets you create a conversational question-and-answer layer over your existing data. Use it to build a knowledge base by extracting questions and answers from your semi-structured content, including FAQ, manuals, and documents. Answer users' questions with the best answers from the QnAs in your knowledge baseâ€”automatically. Your knowledge base gets smarter, too, as it continually learns from user behavior.

These code samples show common scenario operations with the Azure Language QuestionAnswering client library.
The async versions of the samples require Python 3.6 or later.
You can authenticate your client with a QuestionAnswering API key.

These sample programs show common scenarios for the QuestionAnswering client's offerings.
