# Samples for Azure Text Analytics Authoring client library for Python

These code samples show common **Text Authoring** operations with the Azure `azure-ai-textanalytics-authoring` client library.

You can authenticate your client with a Text Authoring API key:

- See [sample_authentication.py][sample_authentication] and [sample_authentication_async.py][sample_authentication_async] for how to authenticate in the above cases.

These sample programs show common scenarios for the Text Authoring clientâ€™s offerings.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later is required to use this package.  
- You must have an [Azure subscription][azure_subscription] and a [Language Service resource][language_resource] to run these samples.

## Setup

1. Install the Azure Text Authoring client library for Python with [pip][pip]:

```bash
pip install azure-ai-textanalytics-authoring
```
For more information about how the versioning of the SDK corresponds to the versioning of the service's API, see [here][versioning_story_readme].

2. Clone or download this sample repository.  
3. Open the sample folder in Visual Studio Code or your IDE of choice.

## Running the samples

1. Open a terminal window and `cd` to the directory where the samples are located.  
2. Set the environment variables specified in the sample file you wish to run.  
   - Typically, you will need to set:  
     - `AZURE_TEXT_AUTHORING_ENDPOINT`  
     - `AZURE_TEXT_AUTHORING_KEY`  
3. Follow the usage described in the file, e.g. `python sample_train.py`
