    This API accepts a request and mediates among multiple language projects, such as LUIS Generally Available, Question Answering, Conversation, and then calls the best candidate service to handle the request. At last, it returns a response with the candidate service's response as a payload.

 In some cases, this API needs to forward requests and responses between the caller and an upstream service.
