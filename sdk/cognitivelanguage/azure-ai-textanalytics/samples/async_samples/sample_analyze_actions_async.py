DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates running multiple **text analysis actions** in a single job (async):
    - Named Entity Recognition
    - Key Phrase Extraction

USAGE:
    python sample_analyze_actions_async.py

REQUIRED ENV VARS (for AAD / DefaultAzureCredential):
    AZURE_TEXT_ENDPOINT
    AZURE_CLIENT_ID
    AZURE_TENANT_ID
    AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET

NOTE:
    If you want to use AzureKeyCredential instead, set:
      - AZURE_TEXT_ENDPOINT
      - AZURE_TEXT_KEY
