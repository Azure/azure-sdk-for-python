## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 later is required to use this package.
- You must have an [Azure subscription][azure_subscription] and a
  [Cognitive Services or Language service resource][ta_or_cs_resource] to use this package.

#### Create a Cognitive Services or Language service resource

The Language service supports both [multi-service and single-service access][multi_and_single_service].
Create a Cognitive Services resource if you plan to access multiple cognitive services under a single endpoint/key. For Language service access only, create a Language service resource.
You can create the resource using the [Azure Portal][azure_portal_create_ta_resource] or [Azure CLI][azure_cli] following the steps in [this document][azure_cli_create_ta_resource].

Interaction with the service using the client library begins with a [client](#textanalyticsclient "TextAnalyticsClient").
To create a client object, you will need the Cognitive Services or Language service `endpoint` to
your resource and a `credential` that allows you access:

```python
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient

credential = AzureKeyCredential("<api_key>")
text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint="https://<resource-name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/", credential=credential)
```

Note that for some Cognitive Services resources the endpoint might look different from the above code snippet.
For example, `https://<region>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/`.

### Install the package

Install the Azure Text Analytics client library for Python with [pip][pip]:

```bash
pip install azure-ai-textanalytics
```

<!-- SNIPPET:sample_authentication.create_ta_client_with_key -->

```python
import os
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalysisClient

endpoint = os.environ["AZURE_TEXT_ENDPOINT"]
key = os.environ["AZURE_TEXT_KEY"]

text_client = TextAnalysisClient(endpoint, AzureKeyCredential(key))
```

<!-- END SNIPPET -->

> Note that `5.2.X` and newer targets the Azure Cognitive Service for Language APIs. These APIs include the text analysis and natural language processing features found in the previous versions of the Text Analytics client library.
In addition, the service API has changed from semantic to date-based versioning. This version of the client library defaults to the latest supported API version, which currently is `2023-04-01`.

This table shows the relationship between SDK versions and supported API versions of the service

| SDK version  | Supported API version of service  |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| 6.0.0b1 - Latest preview release | 3.0, 3.1, 2022-05-01, 2023-04-01, 2024-11-01, 2024-11-15-preview, 2025-05-15-preview (default) |
| 5.3.X - Latest stable release | 3.0, 3.1, 2022-05-01, 2023-04-01 (default) |
| 5.2.X  | 3.0, 3.1, 2022-05-01 (default) |
| 5.1.0  | 3.0, 3.1 (default) |
| 5.0.0  | 3.0 |

API version can be selected by passing the [api_version][text_analytics_client] keyword argument into the client.
For the latest Language service features, consider selecting the most recent beta API version. For production scenarios, the latest stable version is recommended. Setting to an older version may result in reduced feature compatibility.

### Authenticate the client

#### Get the endpoint

You can find the endpoint for your Language service resource using the
[Azure Portal][azure_portal_get_endpoint]
or [Azure CLI][azure_cli_endpoint_lookup]:

```bash
# Get the endpoint for the Language service resource
az cognitiveservices account show --name "resource-name" --resource-group "resource-group-name" --query "properties.endpoint"
```

#### Get the API Key

You can get the [API key][cognitive_authentication_api_key] from the Cognitive Services or Language service resource in the [Azure Portal][azure_portal_get_endpoint].
Alternatively, you can use [Azure CLI][azure_cli_endpoint_lookup] snippet below to get the API key of your resource.

`az cognitiveservices account keys list --name "resource-name" --resource-group "resource-group-name"`

#### Create a TextAnalyticsClient with an API Key Credential

Once you have the value for the API key, you can pass it as a string into an instance of [AzureKeyCredential][azure-key-credential]. Use the key as the credential parameter
to authenticate the client:

<!-- SNIPPET:sample_authentication.create_ta_client_with_key -->

```python
import os
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalysisClient

endpoint = os.environ["AZURE_TEXT_ENDPOINT"]
key = os.environ["AZURE_TEXT_KEY"]

text_client = TextAnalysisClient(endpoint, AzureKeyCredential(key))
```

<!-- END SNIPPET -->

#### Create a TextAnalyticsClient with an Azure Active Directory Credential

To use an [Azure Active Directory (AAD) token credential][cognitive_authentication_aad],
provide an instance of the desired credential type obtained from the
[azure-identity][azure_identity_credentials] library.
Note that regional endpoints do not support AAD authentication. Create a [custom subdomain][custom_subdomain]
name for your resource in order to use this type of authentication.

Authentication with AAD requires some initial setup:

- [Install azure-identity][install_azure_identity]
- [Register a new AAD application][register_aad_app]
- [Grant access][grant_role_access] to the Language service by assigning the `"Cognitive Services Language Reader"` role to your service principal.

After setup, you can choose which type of [credential][azure_identity_credentials] from azure.identity to use.
As an example, [DefaultAzureCredential][default_azure_credential]
can be used to authenticate the client:

Set the values of the client ID, tenant ID, and client secret of the AAD application as environment variables:
AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET

Use the returned token credential to authenticate the client:

<!-- SNIPPET:sample_authentication.create_ta_client_with_aad -->

```python
import os
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalysisClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

endpoint = os.environ["AZURE_TEXT_ENDPOINT"]
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

text_client = TextAnalysisClient(endpoint, credential=credential)
```

<!-- END SNIPPET -->

## Key concepts

### TextAnalyticsClient

The Text Analytics client library provides a [TextAnalyticsClient][text_analytics_client] to do analysis on [batches of documents](#examples "Examples").
It provides both synchronous and asynchronous operations to access a specific use of text analysis, such as language detection or key phrase extraction.

### Input

A **document** is a single unit to be analyzed by the predictive models in the Language service.
The input for each operation is passed as a **list** of documents.

Each document can be passed as a string in the list, e.g.

```python
documents = ["I hated the movie. It was so slow!", "The movie made it into my top ten favorites. What a great movie!"]
```

or, if you wish to pass in a per-item document `id` or `language`/`country_hint`, they can be passed as a list of
[DetectLanguageInput][detect_language_input] or
[TextDocumentInput][text_document_input]
or a dict-like representation of the object:

```python
documents = [
    {"id": "1", "language": "en", "text": "I hated the movie. It was so slow!"},
    {"id": "2", "language": "en", "text": "The movie made it into my top ten favorites. What a great movie!"},
]
```

See [service limitations][service_limits] for the input, including document length limits, maximum batch size, and supported text encoding.

### Return Value

The return value for a single document can be a result or error object.
A heterogeneous list containing a collection of result and error objects is returned from each operation.
These results/errors are index-matched with the order of the provided documents.

A **result**, such as [AnalyzeSentimentResult][analyze_sentiment_result],
is the result of a text analysis operation and contains a prediction or predictions about a document input.

The **error** object, [DocumentError][document_error], indicates that the service had trouble processing the document and contains
the reason it was unsuccessful.

### Document Error Handling

You can filter for a result or error object in the list by using the `is_error` attribute. For a result object this is always `False` and for a
[DocumentError][document_error] this is `True`.

For example, to filter out all DocumentErrors you might use list comprehension:

```python
response = text_analytics_client.analyze_sentiment(documents)
successful_responses = [doc for doc in response if not doc.is_error]
```

You can also use the `kind` attribute to filter between result types:

```python
poller = text_analytics_client.begin_analyze_actions(documents, actions)
response = poller.result()
for result in response:
    if result.kind == "SentimentAnalysis":
        print(f"Sentiment is {result.sentiment}")
    elif result.kind == "KeyPhraseExtraction":
        print(f"Key phrases: {result.key_phrases}")
    elif result.is_error is True:
        print(f"Document error: {result.code}, {result.message}")
```

### Long-Running Operations

Long-running operations are operations which consist of an initial request sent to the service to start an operation,
followed by polling the service at intervals to determine whether the operation has completed or failed, and if it has
succeeded, to get the result.

Methods that support healthcare analysis, custom text analysis, or multiple analyses are modeled as long-running operations.
The client exposes a `begin_<method-name>` method that returns a poller object. Callers should wait
for the operation to complete by calling `result()` on the poller object returned from the `begin_<method-name>` method.
Sample code snippets are provided to illustrate using long-running operations [below](#examples "Examples").

## Examples

    else:
        print("No documents in the response or unexpected result type.")
```

<!-- END SNIPPET -->

The returned response is a heterogeneous list of result and error objects: list[[AnalyzeSentimentResult][analyze_sentiment_result], [DocumentError][document_error]]

and [supported types][named_entity_categories].

### Recognize Linked Entities

[recognize_linked_entities][recognize_linked_entities] recognizes and disambiguates the identity of each entity found in its input text (for example,
determining whether an occurrence of the word Mars refers to the planet, or to the
Roman god of war). Recognized entities are associated with URLs to a well-known knowledge base, like Wikipedia.

The returned response is an object encapsulating multiple iterables, each representing results of individual analyses.

Note: Multiple analysis is available in API version v3.1 and newer.

## Optional Configuration

Optional keyword arguments can be passed in at the client and per-operation level.
The azure-core [reference documentation][azure_core_ref_docs]
describes available configurations for retries, logging, transport protocols, and more.

## Troubleshooting

### General

The Text Analytics client will raise exceptions defined in [Azure Core][azure_core].

### Logging

This library uses the standard
[logging][python_logging] library for logging.
Basic information about HTTP sessions (URLs, headers, etc.) is logged at INFO
level.

Detailed DEBUG level logging, including request/response bodies and unredacted
headers, can be enabled on a client with the `logging_enable` keyword argument:

```python
import sys
import logging
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient

# Create a logger for the 'azure' SDK
logger = logging.getLogger('azure')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Configure a console output
handler = logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout)
logger.addHandler(handler)

endpoint = "https://<resource-name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/"
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# This client will log detailed information about its HTTP sessions, at DEBUG level
text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint, credential, logging_enable=True)
result = text_analytics_client.analyze_sentiment(["I did not like the restaurant. The food was too spicy."])
```

Similarly, `logging_enable` can enable detailed logging for a single operation,
even when it isn't enabled for the client:

```python
result = text_analytics_client.analyze_sentiment(documents, logging_enable=True)
```

## Next steps
