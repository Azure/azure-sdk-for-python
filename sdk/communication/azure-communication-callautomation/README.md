# Azure Communication Call Automation client library for Python

This package contains a Python SDK for Azure Communication Call Automation. Call Automation provides developers the ability to build server-based, intelligent call workflows, and call recording for voice and PSTN channels.

[Overview of Call Automation][overview] | [Product documentation][product_docs]

## _Disclaimer_
_Azure SDK Python packages support for Python 2.7 has ended 01 January 2022. For more information and questions, please
refer to https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/20691_

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later is required to use this package.
- You need an [Azure subscription][azure_sub] to use this package.
- A deployed Communication Services resource. You can use the [Azure Portal][azure_portal] or the [Azure PowerShell][azure_powershell] to set it up.

### Installing
Install the Azure Communication Service Call Automation SDK.

```bash
pip install azure-communication-callautomation
```

| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CallAutomationClient | `CallAutomationClient` is the primary interface for developers using this client library. It can be used to initiate calls by `createCall` or `answerCall`. It can also be used to do recording actions such as `startRecording`                                                                                                         |                                                                      |
| CallConnectionClient | `CallConnectionClient` represents a ongoing call. Once the call is established with `createCall` or `answerCall`, further actions can be performed for the call, such as `transfer` or `play_media`.                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                               |
| Callback Events      | Callback events are events sent back during duration of the call. It gives information and state of the call, such as `CallConnected`. `CallbackUrl` must be provided during `createCall` and `answerCall`, and callback events will be sent to this url. |
| Incoming Call Event  | When incoming call happens (that can be answered with `answerCall`), incoming call eventgrid event will be sent. This is different from Callback events above, and should be setup on Azure portal. See [Incoming Call][incomingcall] for detail.                                                                                        |

## Examples
### Initialize CallAutomationClient
```Python
from azure.communication.callautomation import (CallAutomationClient)

# Your unique Azure Communication service endpoint
endpoint_url = '<ENDPOINT>'
client = CallAutomationClient.from_connection_string(endpoint_url)
```

### Create Call
```Python
from azure.communication.callautomation import (
    CallAutomationClient,
    CommunicationUserIdentifier
)

# target endpoint for ACS User
user = CommunicationUserIdentifier("8:acs:...")

# callback url to receive callback events
callback_url = "https://<MY-EVENT-HANDLER-URL>/events"

# send out the invitation, creating call
result = client.create_call(
    target_participant=user,
    callback_url=callback_uri
)

# this id can be used to do further actions in the call
call_connection_id = result.call_connection_id
```

### Play Media
```Python
# using call connection id, get call connection
call_connection = client.get_call_connection(call_connection_id)

# from callconnection of result above, play media to all participants
my_file = FileSource(url="https://<FILE-SOURCE>/<SOME-FILE>.wav")
call_connection.play_to_all(my_file)
```
