# Azure Communication Phone Numbers Package client library for Python

Azure Communication Phone Numbers client package is used to administer Phone Numbers. 

# Getting started
### Prerequisites
- Python 2.7, or 3.5 or later is required to use this package.
- You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- A deployed Communication Services resource. You can use the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp) or the [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.communication/new-azcommunicationservice) to set it up.
### Install the package
Install the Azure Communication Phone Numbers client library for Python with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```bash
pip install azure-communication-phonenumbers
```

## Key concepts

### Initializing Phone Numbers Client
```python
# You can find your connection string from your resource in the Azure Portal
import os
from azure.communication.phonenumbers import PhoneNumbersClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

endpoint = os.getenv('AZURE_COMMUNICATION_SERVICE_CONNECTION_STRING')

# To use Azure Active Directory Authentication (DefaultAzureCredential) make sure to have your
# AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID and AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET as env variables.
phone_number_administration_client = PhoneNumbersAdministrationClient(endpoint, DefaultAzureCredential())

```
### Initializing the Client Using Your Connection String
Connection string authentication is also available for Phone Numbers Client.

```python
# You can find your connection string from your resource in the Azure Portal
import os
from azure.communication.phonenumbers import PhoneNumbersClient

connection_str = os.getenv('AZURE_COMMUNICATION_SERVICE_CONNECTION_STRING')
phone_number_administration_client = PhoneNumbersAdministrationClient.from_connection_string(connection_str)
```

### Phone Number Types overview

Phone numbers come in two types; Geographic and Toll-Free. Geographic phone numbers are phone numbers associated with a location, whose area codes are associated with the area code of a geographic location. Toll-Free phone numbers are phone numbers with no associated location. For example, in the US, toll-free numbers can come with area codes such as 800 or 888.

### Searching and Purchasing and Releasing numbers

Phone numbers can be searched through the search creation API by providing an area code, quantity of phone numbers, application type, phone number type, and capabilities. The provided quantity of phone numbers will be reserved for ten minutes and can be purchased within this time. If the search is not purchased, the phone numbers will become available to others after ten minutes. If the search is purchased, then the phone numbers are acquired for the Azure resources.

Phone numbers can also be released using the release API.

## Examples

### Get All Phone Numbers

Lists all of your acquired phone numbers

```python
acquired_phone_numbers = phone_numbers_client.list_acquired_phone_numbers()
acquired_phone_number = acquired_phone_numbers.next()
print(acquired_phone_number.phone_number)
```

### Get Phone Number

Gets the information from the specified phone number

```python
result = phone_numbers_client.get_phone_number("<phone number>")
print(result.country_code)
print(result.phone_number)
```

## Long Running Operations

The Phone Number Client supports a variety of long running operations that allow indefinite polling time to the functions listed down below.

### Search for Available Phone Number

You can search for available phone numbers by providing the capabilities of the phone you want to acquire, the phone number type, the assignment type, and the country code. It's worth mentioning that for the toll-free phone number type, proving the area code is optional.
The result of the search can then be used to purchase the number in the corresponding API.

```python
capabilities = PhoneNumberCapabilities(
        calling = PhoneNumberCapabilityType.INBOUND,
        sms = PhoneNumberCapabilityType.INBOUND_OUTBOUND
    )
poller = phone_numbers_client.begin_search_available_phone_numbers(
    "US",
    PhoneNumberType.TOLL_FREE,
    PhoneNumberAssignmentType.APPLICATION,
    capabilities,
    area_code ="833", # Area code is optional for toll-free numbers
    quantity = 2, # Quantity is optional. If not set, default is 1
    polling = True
)
search_result = poller.result()
```

### Purchase Phone Numbers

The result of your search can be used to purchase the specificied phone numbers. This can be done by passing the `search_id` from the search response to the purchase phone number API.

```python
purchase_poller = phone_numbers_client.begin_purchase_phone_numbers(
    search_result.search_id, 
    polling=True
)
```

### Release Phone Number

Releases an acquired phone number.

```python
poller = self.phone_number_client.begin_release_phone_number(
    "<phone number>", 
    polling = True
)
```

### Updating Phone Number Capabilities

Updates the specified phone number capabilities for Calling and SMS to one of: 

- `PhoneNumberCapabilityType.NONE`
- `PhoneNumberCapabilityType.INBOUND`
- `PhoneNumberCapabilityType.OUTBOUND`
- `PhoneNumberCapabilityType.INBOUND_OUTBOUND`

```python
poller = self.phone_number_client.begin_update_phone_number_capabilities(
    "<phone number>",
    PhoneNumberCapabilityType.OUTBOUND,
    PhoneNumberCapabilityType.INBOUND_OUTBOUND,
    polling = True
)
```

# Troubleshooting
The Phone Numbers Administration client will raise exceptions defined in [Azure Core][azure_core].
