# Azure Communication Identity Package client library for Python

Azure Communication Identity client package is intended to be used to setup the basics for opening a way to use Azure Communication Service offerings. This package helps to create identities user tokens to be used by other client packages such as chat, calling, sms. 

# Getting started
### Prerequisites
- Python 2.7, or 3.5 or later is required to use this package.
- You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- A deployed Communication Services resource. You can use the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp) or the [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.communication/new-azcommunicationservice) to set it up.
### Install the package
Install the Azure Communication Identity client library for Python with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```bash
pip install azure-communication-identity
```

# Key concepts
## CommunicationIdentityClient
`CommunicationIdentityClient` provides operations for:

- Create/delete identities to be used in Azure Communication Services. Those identities can be used to make use of Azure Communication offerings and can be scoped to have limited abilities through token scopes.

- Create/revoke scoped user access tokens to access services such as chat, calling, sms. Tokens are issued for a valid Azure Communication identity and can be revoked at any time.

### Initializing Identity Client
```python
# You can find your endpoint and access token from your resource in the Azure Portal
import os
from azure.communication.identity import CommunicationIdentityClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

connection_str = os.getenv('AZURE_COMMUNICATION_SERVICE_CONNECTION_STRING')
endpoint = os.getenv('AZURE_COMMUNICATION_SERVICE_ENDPOINT')

# To use Azure Active Directory Authentication (DefaultAzureCredential) make sure to have
# AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID and AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET as env variables.
identity_client_managed_identity = CommunicationIdentityClient(endpoint, DefaultAzureCredential())

#You can also authenticate using your connection string
identity_client = CommunicationIdentityClient.from_connection_string(connection_str)

```

## Examples
The following section provides several code snippets covering some of the most common Azure Communication Services tasks, including:

### Creating a new user

Use the `create_user` method to create a new user. 
```python
user = identity_client.create_user()
print("User created with id:" + user.identifier)
```

Alternatively, use the `create_user_with_token` method to create a new user and issue a token for it.\
For this option, a list of `CommunicationTokenScope` must be defined (see "Issuing an access token" for more information)

```python
user, tokenresponse = identity_client.create_user_with_token(scopes=[CommunicationTokenScope.CHAT])
print("User id:" + user.identifier)
print("Token issued with value: " + tokenresponse.token)
```

### Issuing or Refreshing an access token for a user

Use the `issue_token` method to issue or refresh a scoped access token for the user. \
Pass in the user object as a parameter, and a list of `CommunicationTokenScope`. Scope options are:
- `CHAT` (Chat)
- `VOIP` (VoIP)

```python
tokenresponse = identity_client.issue_token(user, scopes=[CommunicationTokenScope.CHAT])
print("Token issued with value: " + tokenresponse.token)
```

### Revoking a user's access tokens

Use `revoke_tokens` to revoke all access tokens for a user. Pass in the user object as a parameter
```python
identity_client.revoke_tokens(user)
```

### Deleting a user

Use the `delete_user` method to delete a user. Pass in the user object as a parameter
```python
identity_client.delete_user(user)
```

# Troubleshooting
The Azure Communication Service Identity client will raise exceptions defined in [Azure Core][azure_core].
