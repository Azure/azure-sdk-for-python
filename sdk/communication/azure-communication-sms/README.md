# Azure Communication SMS Package client library for Python

This package contains a Python SDK for Azure Communication Services for SMS.
Read more about Azure Communication Services [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/overview)

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 2.7, or 3.5 or later is required to use this package.
- A deployed Communication Services resource. You can use the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp) or the [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.communication/new-azcommunicationservice) to set it up.
- You must have a phone number configured that is associated with an Azure subscription

### Install the package

Install the Azure Communication SMS client library for Python with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```bash
pip install azure-communication-sms
```

## Key concepts

Azure Communication SMS package is used to do following:
- Send an SMS

## Examples

The following section provides several code snippets covering some of the most common Azure Communication Services tasks, including:

- [Client Initialization](#client-initialization)
- [Sending an SMS](#sending-an-sms)

### Client Initialization

To initialize the SMS Client, the connection string can be used to instantiate.
Alternatively, you can also use Active Directory authentication using DefaultAzureCredential.

```Python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

connection_str = os.getenv('AZURE_COMMUNICATION_SERVICE_CONNECTION_STRING')
sms_client = SmsClient.from_connection_string(connection_string)
# To use Azure Active Directory Authentication (DefaultAzureCredential) make sure to have
# AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID and AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET as env variables.
endpoint = os.getenv('AZURE_COMMUNICATION_SERVICE_ENDPOINT')
sms_client = SmsClient(endpoint, DefaultAzureCredential())
```

### Sending an SMS

Once the client is initialized, the `.send()` method can be invoked:

```Python
smsresponse = sms_client.send(
    from_phone_number=PhoneNumberIdentifier("<leased-phone-number>"),
    to_phone_numbers=[PhoneNumberIdentifier("<to-phone-number>")],
    message="Hello World via SMS",
    send_sms_options=SendSmsOptions(enable_delivery_report=True)) # optional property
```

- `leased-phone-number`: an SMS enabled phone number associated with your communication service
- `to-phone-number`: the phone number you wish to send a message to
- `send_sms_options`: an optional parameter that you can use to configure Delivery Reporting. This is useful for scenarios where you want to emit events when SMS messages are delivered.

## Troubleshooting
The Azure Communication Service Identity client will raise exceptions defined in [Azure Core][azure_core].
