## _Disclaimer_

_Azure SDK Python packages support for Python 2.7 has ended 01 January 2022. For more information and questions, please refer to https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/20691_

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later is required to use this package.
- A deployed Communication Services resource. You can use the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp) or the [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.communication/new-azcommunicationservice) to set it up.
- You must have a phone number configured that is associated with an Azure subscription

### Install the package

Install the Azure Communication JobRouter client library for Python with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```bash
pip install azure-communication-jobrouter
```

## Key concepts

### Job

A Job is a unit of work (demand), which must be routed to an available Worker (supply). A real-world example is an incoming call or chat in the context of a call center.

### Worker

A Worker is the supply available to handle a Job. When you use the SDK to register a Worker to receive jobs, you can specify:

 - One or more queues to listen on.
 - The number of concurrent jobs per Channel that the Worker can handle.
 - A set of Labels that can be used to group and select workers. 

A real-world example is an agent in a call center.

### Queue

A Queue is an ordered list of jobs, that are waiting to be served to a worker. Workers register with a queue to receive work from it.

A real-world example is a call queue in a call center.

### Channel

A Channel is a grouping of jobs by some type. When a worker registers to receive work, they must also specify for which channels they can handle work, and how much of each can they handle concurrently. Channels are just a string discriminator and aren't explicitly created.

Real-world examples are `voice calls` or `chats` in a call center.

### Offer

An Offer is extended by Job Router to a worker to handle a particular job when it determines a match. You can either accept or decline the offer with the JobRouter SDK. If you ignore the offer, it expires according to the time to live configured on the Distribution Policy.

A real-world example is the ringing of an agent in a call center.


### Distribution Policy

A Distribution Policy is a configuration set that controls how jobs in a queue are distributed to workers registered with that queue. This configuration includes:

 - How long an Offer is valid before it expires.
 - The distribution mode, which define the order in which workers are picked when there are multiple available.
 - How many concurrent offers can there be for a given job.

### Labels

You can attach labels to workers, jobs, and queues. Labels are key value pairs that can be of `string`, `number`, or `boolean` data types.

A real-world example is the skill level of a particular worker or the team or geographic location.

### Worker selectors

Worker selectors can be attached to a job in order to target a subset of workers on the queue.

A real-world example is a condition on an incoming call that the agent must have a minimum level of knowledge of a particular product.

### Classification policy

A classification policy can be used to programmatically select a queue, determine job priority, or attach worker label selectors to a job.

### Queue selectors

Queue selectors can be attached to a classification policy in order to target a queue which fulfills certain conditions.
This queue is used enqueueing an incoming job.

A real-world example is a condition on an incoming call that the call has to get queued to a queue which supports `chat`.


### Exception policy

An exception policy controls the behavior of a Job based on a trigger and executes a desired action. The exception policy is attached to a Queue so it can control the behavior of Jobs in the Queue.


## Examples

### Client Initialization
To initialize the SMS Client, the connection string can be used to instantiate.
Alternatively, you can also use Active Directory authentication using DefaultAzureCredential.

```python
from azure.communication.jobrouter import RouterClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

connection_string = "endpoint=ENDPOINT;accessKey=KEY"
router_client = RouterClient.from_connection_string(conn_str = connection_string)

# To use Azure Active Directory Authentication (DefaultAzureCredential) make sure to have
# AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID and AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET as env variables.
endpoint = "https://<RESOURCE_NAME>.communication.azure.com"
router_client = RouterClient(endpoint, DefaultAzureCredential())
```

### Create or update exception policy

Once the client is initialized, the `upsert_exception_policy` method can be invoked to create or update exception policy.

```python
from azure.communication.jobrouter import (
    RouterClient,
    WaitTimeExceptionTrigger,
    QueueLengthExceptionTrigger,
    CancelExceptionAction,
    ExceptionRule
)

# set `connection_string` to an existing ACS endpoint
connection_string = "endpoint=ENDPOINT;accessKey=KEY"
router_client = RouterClient.from_connection_string(conn_str = connection_string)
print("RouterClient created successfully!")

# define an exception trigger
# set up a QueueLengthExceptionTrigger with a threshold of 10,
# i.e., kick off exception if there are already 10 jobs in a queue
exception_trigger = QueueLengthExceptionTrigger(threshold = 10)

# define an exception action
# this sets up what action to take when an exception trigger condition is fulfilled
# for this scenario, we simply cancel job
exception_action = CancelExceptionAction()

# define the exception rule combining the trigger and action
# you can chain multiple rules together, so it is important to give a unique
# `id` to the exception rule. For this use-case, the exception rule will be the following

exception_rule = {
    "CancelJobWhenQueueThresholdIs10": ExceptionRule(
        trigger = exception_trigger,
        actions = {
            "CancelJobActionWhenQueueIsFull": exception_action
        }
    )
}

# create the exception policy
# set a unique value to `policy_id`
policy_id = "exception_policy"

exception_policy = router_client.upsert_exception_policy(
    identifier = policy_id,
    name = "TriggerJobCancellationWhenQueueLenIs10",
    exception_rules = exception_rule
)

print(f"Exception policy has been successfully created with id: {exception_policy.id}")

# add additional exception rule to policy
new_exception_trigger = WaitTimeExceptionTrigger(threshold = "PT1H")
new_exception_rule = ExceptionRule(
    trigger = new_exception_trigger,
    actions = {
        "CancelJobActionWhenJobInQFor1Hr": exception_action
    }
)
exception_policy.exception_rules["CancelJobWhenInQueueFor1Hr"] = new_exception_rule

updated_exception_policy = router_client.upsert_exception_policy(
    identifier = policy_id,
    exception_policy = exception_policy
)

print(f"Exception policy updated with rules: {[k for k,v in updated_exception_policy.exception_rules.items()]}")
print("Exception policy has been successfully updated")
```

- `identifier`: Id of the exception policy.
- `exception_rules`: (Optional) A dictionary collection of exception rules on the exception policy. Key is the Id of each exception rule.
- `name`: (Optional) An user-friendly name of the policy.
- `exception_policy`: (Optional) An instance of exception policy. If this is provided, then upsert request will be made using this. Generally it is expected to be used when updating an existing policy.

### Get an exception policy

Use `get_exception_policy` to retrieve an existing exception policy.

```python
policy_id = "exception_policy"

exception_policy = router_client.get_exception_policy(identifier = policy_id)

print(f"Successfully fetched exception policy with id: {exception_policy.id}")
```

- `identifier`: Id of the exception policy.

### List exception policies

Use `list_exception_policies` to retrieve a list of exception policies that have been already created.

```python
exception_policy_iterator = router_client.list_exception_policies(results_per_page = 10)

for policy_page in exception_policy_iterator.by_page():
    policies_in_page = list(policy_page)
    print(f"Retrieved {len(policies_in_page)} policies in current page")

    for ep in policies_in_page:
        print(f"Retrieved exception policy with id: {ep.id}")

print(f"Successfully completed fetching exception policies")
```
- `results_per_page`: (Optional) The maximum number of policies to be returned per page.

### Delete an exception policy

Use `delete_exception_policy` to delete an exception policy.

```python
router_client.delete_exception_policy(identifier = policy_id)
```

- `identifier`: Id of the exception policy.
