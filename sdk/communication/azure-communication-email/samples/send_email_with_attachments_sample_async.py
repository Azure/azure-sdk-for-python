FILE: send_email_with_attachments_sample_async.py
DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates sending an email with an attachment. The Email client is 
    authenticated using a connection string.
USAGE:
    python send_email_with_attachment_async.py
    Set the environment variable with your own value before running the sample:
    1) COMMUNICATION_CONNECTION_STRING_EMAIL - the connection string in your ACS resource
    2) SENDER_ADDRESS - the address found in the linked domain that will send the email
    3) RECIPIENT_ADDRESS - the address that will receive the email
