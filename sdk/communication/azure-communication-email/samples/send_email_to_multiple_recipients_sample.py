    1) COMMUNICATION_CONNECTION_STRING - the connection string in your ACS resource
    2) SENDER_ADDRESS - the address found in the linked domain that will send the email
    3) RECIPIENT_ADDRESS - the address that will receive the email
    4) SECOND_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS - the second address that will receive the email
