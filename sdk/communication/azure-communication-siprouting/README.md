# Azure Communication SIP routing Package client library for Python

This package contains a Python SDK for Azure Communication Services for SIP.
Read more about Azure Communication Services [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/overview).

This package has been tested with Python 2.7, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.

For a more complete set of Azure libraries, see https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all.

# Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 2.7, or 3.6 or later is required to use this package.
- A deployed Communication Services resource. You can use the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp) or the [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.communication/new-azcommunicationservice) to set it up.
- You must have a phone number configured that is associated with an Azure subscription

### Install the package

Install the Azure Communication SIP client library for Python with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```bash
pip install azure-communication-siprouting
```

# Key concepts

Azure Communication SIP package is used to do the following:

- Retrieve SIP configuration
- Update SIP configuration

# Examples

The following section provides several code snippets covering some of the most common SIP configuration tasks, including:

- [Client Initialization](#client-initialization)
- [Retrieve SIP configuration](#retrieve-sip-configuration)
- [Update SIP configuration](#update-sip-configuration)
- [Update SIP trunks](#update-sip-trunks)
- [Update SIP routes](#update-sip-routes)


### Client Initialization: {#client-initialization}

Initialize client with the service endpoint and azure credentials:

```python
from azure.communication.siprouting import SIPRoutingClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
# To use Azure Active Directory Authentication (DefaultAzureCredential) make sure to have
# AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID and AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET as env variables.
endpoint = "https://<RESOURCE_NAME>.communication.azure.com"
sip_client = SIPRoutingClient(endpoint,DefaultAzureCredential())
```

Or initialize the client from connection string:

```python
from azure.communication.siprouting import SIPRoutingClient
connection_string = "endpoint=ENDPOINT;accessKey=KEY"
sip_client = SIPRoutingClient.from_connection_string(connection_string)
```

### Retrieve SIP configuration: {#retrieve-sip-configuration}

Get the current SIP configuration:

```python
result = sip_client.get_sip_configuration()
print(result.trunks)
print(result.routes)
```

### Update SIP configuration: {#update-sip-configuration}

Set new SIP configuration trunks and routes:

```python
result = sip_client.update_sip_configuration(NEW_TRUNKS_CONFIGURATION,NEW_ROUTES_CONFIGURATION)
```

### Update SIP trunks: {#update-sip-trunks}

Set new SIP configuration trunks:

```python
result = sip_client.update_sip_trunks(NEW_TRUNKS_CONFIGURATION)
```

### Update SIP routes: {#update-sip-routes}

Set new SIP configuration routes:

```python
result = sip_client.update_sip_routes(NEW_ROUTES_CONFIGURATION)
```

# Troubleshooting

The SIP configuration client will raise exceptions defined in [Azure Core][azure_core].
