# Azure Communication Administration Package client library for Python

Azure Communication Administration client package is intended to be used to setup the basics for opening a way to use Azure Communication Service offerings. This package helps to create identities user tokens to be used by other client packages such as chat, calling, sms. 

# Getting started
### Prerequisites
* Python 2.7, or 3.5 or later is required to use this package.
* You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)

### Install the package
Install the Azure Communication Administration client library for Python with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```bash
pip install azure-communication-administration
```

# Key concepts
## CommunicationIdentityClient
`CommunicationIdentityClient` provides operations for:

- Create/delete identities to be used in Azure Communication Services. Those identities can be used to make use of Azure Communication offerings and can be scoped to have limited abilities through token scopes.

- Create/revoke scoped user access tokens to access services such as chat, calling, sms. Tokens are issued for a valid Azure Communication identity and can be revoked at any time.

## CommunicationPhoneNumberClient
### Phone plans overview

Phone plans come in two types; Geographic and Toll-Free. Geographic phone plans are phone plans associated with a location, whose phone numbers' area codes are associated with the area code of a geographic location. Toll-Free phone plans are phone plans not associated location. For example, in the US, toll-free numbers can come with area codes such as 800 or 888.

All geographic phone plans within the same country are grouped into a phone plan group with a Geographic phone number type. All Toll-Free phone plans within the same country are grouped into a phone plan group.

### Searching and Acquiring numbers

Phone numbers search can be search through the search creation API by providing a phone plan id, an area code and quantity of phone numbers. The provided quantity of phone numbers will be reserved for ten minutes. This search of phone numbers can either be cancelled or purchased. If the search is cancelled, then the phone numbers will become available to others. If the search is purchased, then the phone numbers are acquired for the Azure resources.

### Configuring / Assigning numbers

Phone numbers can be assigned to a callback URL via the configure number API. As part of the configuration, you will need an acquired phone number, callback URL and application id.
