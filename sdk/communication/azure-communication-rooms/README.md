# Azure Communication Rooms client library for Python
This package contains a Python SDK for Azure Communication Services for Rooms.
Read more about Azure Communication Services [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/overview)

## _Disclaimer_

_Azure SDK Python packages support for Python 2.7 has ended 01 January 2022. For more information and questions, please
refer to https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/20691_

## Key concepts

The Azure Communication Rooms package is used to do following:
- Create scheduled meetings
- Create meetings with managed permissions for its participants
## Getting started

### Installating the package

```bash
python -m pip install azure-communication-rooms
```

#### Prequisites

- Python 3.7 or later is required to use this package.
- You need an [Azure subscription][azure_sub] to use this package.
- A deployed Communication Services resource. You can use the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp) or the [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.communication/new-azcommunicationservice) to set it up.


### Client Initialization

To initialize the Rooms Client, the connection string can be used to instantiate.

```python
from azure.communication.rooms import RoomsClient

client = RoomsClient.from_connection_string(conn_str='<connection_str>' )
```
## Examples

### Key parameters

- `valid_from`: A datetime object from which room will start existing
- `valid_until`: A datetime object after which room meeting would end
- `participants`: A list of `RoomParticipant`s containing MRI's of invitees to the room as well as optional `ParticipantRole`. If `ParticipantRole` is not specified, then it will be `Attendee` by default.
All the above attributes are optional. The service provides default values of valid_until and
valid_from if they are missing. The default for`valid_from` is current date time and the default for `valid_until` is `valid_from + 180 days`.
- `pstn_dial_out_enabled`: Set this flag to true if, at the time of the call, dial out to a PSTN number is enabled in a particular room. This flag is optional.

### Create a room
To create a room, call the `create_room` function from `RoomsClient`. The `valid_from`, `valid_until`, and `participants` arguments are all optional.
Starting in 1.1.0b1 release, ACS Rooms supports PSTN Dial-Out feature. To create room with PSTN Dial-Out property, call `create_room` function and set `pstn_dial_out_enabled` to either true or false. If `pstn_dial_out_enabled` is not provided, then the default value for `pstn_dial_out_enabled` is false.

```python
from azure.core.exceptions import HttpResponseError
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from azure.communication.rooms import (
    RoomsClient,
    RoomParticipant,
    ParticipantRole
)
from azure.communication.identity import CommunicationUserIdentifier
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta

client = RoomsClient.from_connection_string(conn_str='<connection_str>')
valid_from = datetime.now()
valid_until = valid_from + relativedelta(months=+1)
participants = []
participants.append(RoomParticipant(communication_identifier=CommunicationUserIdentifier("<ACS User MRI identity 1>")))
participants.append(RoomParticipant(communication_identifier=CommunicationUserIdentifier("<ACS User MRI identity 2>"), role=ParticipantRole.CONSUMER))
participants.append(RoomParticipant(communication_identifier=CommunicationUserIdentifier("<ACS User MRI identity 3>"), role=ParticipantRole.PRESENTER))

try:
    create_room_response = client.create_room(
        valid_from=valid_from,
        valid_until=valid_until,
        participants=participants,
        pstn_dial_out_enabled=false

    )
except HttpResponseError as ex:
    print(ex)
```
### Update a room
The `valid_from` and `valid_until` properties of a created room can be updated by calling the `update_room` function from `RoomsClient`.
Starting in 1.1.0b1 release, ACS Rooms supports PSTN Dial-Out feature. To update a room with PSTN Dial-Out property, call `update_room` and set `pstn_dial_out_enabled` to either true or false. If `pstn_dial_out_enabled`  is not provided, then there is no changes to PstnDialOutEnabled property in the room.

```python
try:
    update_room_response = client.update_room(
        room_id="id of the room to be updated",
        valid_from=datetime.now(),
        valid_until=valid_from + timedelta(weeks=4),
        pstn_dial_out_enabled=false
    )
except HttpResponseError as e:
    print('service responds error: {}'.format(e))

```

### Get a room
A created room can be retrieved by calling the `get_room` function from `RoomsClient` and passing in the associated `room_id`.

```python
try:
    get_room_response = client.get_room(room_id="id of the room to get")
except HttpResponseError as ex:
    print(ex)
```

### List rooms
Retrieve all valid rooms created with an ACS resource by calling the `list_rooms` function from `RoomsClient`.

```python
try:
    list_room_response = client.list_rooms()
except HttpResponseError as ex:
    print(ex)
```

### Delete a room
To delete a room, call the `delete_room` function from RoomsClient.

```python
try:
    client.delete_room(
        room_id="id of the room to be deleted")
except HttpResponseError as e:
    print('service responds error: {}'.format(e))

```

### Add or update participants in a room
In order to insert new participants or update existing participants, call the `add_or_update_participants` function from RoomsClient.

```python
participants = []
participants.append(RoomParticipant(communication_identifier=CommunicationUserIdentifier("<ACS User MRI identity 1>")))
participants.append(RoomParticipant(communication_identifier=CommunicationUserIdentifier("<ACS User MRI identity 2>"), role=ParticipantRole.ATTENDEE))
participants.append(RoomParticipant(communication_identifier=CommunicationUserIdentifier("<ACS User MRI identity 3>"), role=ParticipantRole.CONSUMER))
try:
    response = client.add_or_update_participants(
        room_id="id of the room to be updated",
        participants=participants
    )
except HttpResponseError as e:
    print('service responds error: {}'.format(e))
```

### Remove participants
Remove participants from a room by calling the `remove_participants` function from RoomsClient.

```python
communication_identifiers = [CommunicationUserIdentifier("<ACS User MRI identity 2>")]

try:
    remove_participants_response = client.remove_participants(
        room_id="id of the room to remove participants",
        participants=communication_identifiers
    )
except HttpResponseError as ex:
    print(ex)
```
### List participants
Retrieve the list of participants for an existing room by referencing the `room_id`:

```python
try:
    participants = client.list_participants(room_id="id of the room to list participants")
except HttpResponseError as ex:
    print(ex)
```
## Troubleshooting

Rooms operations will throw an exception if the request to the server fails. The Rooms client will raise exceptions defined in [Azure Core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/README.md).
