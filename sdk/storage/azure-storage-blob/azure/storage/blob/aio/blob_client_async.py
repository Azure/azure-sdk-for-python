        shared access key, or an instance of a TokenCredentials class from azure.identity.

        :param bool overwrite: Whether the blob to be uploaded should overwrite the current data.
            If True, upload_blob will silently overwrite the existing data. If set to False, the
            operation will fail with ResourceExistsError. The exception to the above is with Append

            blob will be deleted, and a new one created.

            that was sent. This is primarily valuable for detecting bitflips on
            the wire if using http instead of https as https (the default) will
            already validate. Note that this MD5 hash is not stored with the

            will not be used, because computing the MD5 hash requires buffering
            entire blocks, and doing so defeats the purpose of the memory-efficient algorithm.

            the resource has not been modified since the specified date/time.
        :param str if_match:
            An ETag value, or the wildcard character (*). Specify this header to perform
            the operation only if the resource's ETag matches the value specified.
        :param str if_none_match:

        :param ~azure.storage.blob.models.PremiumPageBlobTier premium_page_blob_tier:
            A page blob tier value to set the blob to. The tier correlates to the size of the
            blob and number of allowed IOPS. This is only applicable to page blobs on
            premium storage accounts.
        :param ~azure.storage.blob.models.StandardBlobTier standard_blob_tier:
            A standard blob tier value to set the blob to. For this version of the library,
            this is only applicable to block blobs on standard storage accounts.
        :param int maxsize_condition:
            Optional conditional header. The max length in bytes permitted for
            the append blob. If the Append Block operation would cause the blob
            to exceed that limit or if the blob size is already greater than the
            value specified in this header, the request will fail with
            MaxBlobSizeConditionNotMet error (HTTP status code 412 - Precondition Failed).

            As the encryption key itself is provided in the request,

        """Copies a blob asynchronously.

        This operation returns a copy operation
        object that can be used to wait on the completion of the operation,
        as well as check status or abort the copy operation.
        The Blob service copies blobs on a best-effort basis.

        The source blob for a copy operation may be a block blob, an append blob,
        or a page blob. If the destination blob already exists, it must be of the
        same blob type as the source blob. Any existing destination blob will be
        overwritten. The destination blob cannot be modified while a copy operation
        is in progress.

        When copying from a page blob, the Blob service creates a destination page
        blob of the source blob's length, initially containing all zeroes. Then
        the source page ranges are enumerated, and non-empty ranges are copied.

        For a block blob or an append blob, the Blob service creates a committed
        blob of zero length before returning from this operation. When copying
        from a block blob, all committed blocks and their block IDs are copied.
        Uncommitted blocks are not copied. At the end of the copy operation, the
        destination blob will have the same committed block count as the source.

        When copying from an append blob, all committed blocks are copied. At the
        end of the copy operation, the destination blob will have the same committed
        block count as the source.

        For all blob types, you can call status() on the returned polling object
        to check the status of the copy operation, or wait() to block until the
        operation is complete. The final blob will be committed when the copy completes.

        :param str source_url:
            A URL of up to 2 KB in length that specifies an Azure file or blob.
            The value should be URL-encoded as it would appear in a request URI.
            If the source is in another account, the source must either be public
            or must be authenticated via a shared access signature. If the source
            is public, no authentication is required.
            Examples:
            https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob

            pairs are specified, the destination blob is created with the specified

        :param str source_if_none_match:

            this conditional header to copy the blob only if the specified ETag value
            matches the ETag value for an existing destination blob. If the ETag for
            the destination blob does not match the ETag specified for If-Match, the

            character (*) to perform the operation only if the destination blob does not
            exist. If the specified condition isn't met, the Blob service returns status
            code 412 (Precondition Failed).
        :param destination_lease:
            The lease ID specified for this header must match the lease ID of the
