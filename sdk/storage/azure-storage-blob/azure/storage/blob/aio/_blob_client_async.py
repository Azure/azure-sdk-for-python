        """Copies a blob from the given URL.

        This operation returns a dictionary containing `copy_status` and `copy_id`,
        which can be used to check the status of or abort the copy operation.
        `copy_status` will be 'success' if the copy completed synchronously or
        'pending' if the copy has been started asynchronously. For asynchronous copies,
        the status can be checked by polling the :func:`get_blob_properties` method and
        checking the copy status. Set `requires_sync` to True to force the copy to be synchronous.
        The Blob service copies blobs on a best-effort basis.

        The source blob for a copy operation may be a block blob, an append blob,
        or a page blob. If the destination blob already exists, it must be of the
        same blob type as the source blob. Any existing destination blob will be
        overwritten. The destination blob cannot be modified while a copy operation
        is in progress.

        When copying from a page blob, the Blob service creates a destination page
        blob of the source blob's length, initially containing all zeroes. Then
        the source page ranges are enumerated, and non-empty ranges are copied.

        For a block blob or an append blob, the Blob service creates a committed
        blob of zero length before returning from this operation. When copying
        from a block blob, all committed blocks and their block IDs are copied.
        Uncommitted blocks are not copied. At the end of the copy operation, the
        destination blob will have the same committed block count as the source.

        When copying from an append blob, all committed blocks are copied. At the
        end of the copy operation, the destination blob will have the same committed
        block count as the source.

        :param str source_url:
            A URL of up to 2 KB in length that specifies a file or blob.
            The value should be URL-encoded as it would appear in a request URI.
            If the source is in another account, the source must either be public
            or must be authenticated via a shared access signature. If the source
            is public, no authentication is required.
            Examples:
            https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob

            https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob?snapshot=<DateTime>

            pairs are specified, the destination blob is created with the specified
            metadata, and metadata is not copied from the source blob or file.
        :type metadata: dict(str, str)
        :param bool incremental_copy:
            Copies the snapshot of the source page blob to a destination page blob.
            The snapshot is copied such that only the differential changes between
            the previously copied snapshot are transferred to the destination.
            The copied snapshots are complete copies of the original snapshot and
            can be read or copied from as usual. Defaults to False.
        :keyword tags:
            Name-value pairs associated with the blob as tag. Tags are case-sensitive.
            The tag set may contain at most 10 tags.  Tag keys must be between 1 and 128 characters,
            and tag values must be between 0 and 256 characters.
            Valid tag key and value characters include: lowercase and uppercase letters, digits (0-9),
            space (` `), plus (+), minus (-), period (.), solidus (/), colon (:), equals (=), underscore (_).

            The (case-sensitive) literal "COPY" can instead be passed to copy tags from the source blob.
            This option is only available when `incremental_copy=False` and `requires_sync=True`.
