            If True, upload_blob will overwrite the existing data. If set to False, the
            operation will fail with ResourceExistsError. The exception to the above is with Append
            blob types: if set to False and the data already exists, an error will not be raised

        :keyword bool validate_content:
            If true, calculates an MD5 hash for each chunk of the blob. The storage
            service checks the hash of the content that has arrived with the hash
            that was sent. This is primarily valuable for detecting bitflips on
            the wire if using http instead of https, as https (the default), will
            already validate. Note that this MD5 hash is not stored with the
            blob. Also note that if enabled, the memory-efficient upload algorithm
            will not be used because computing the MD5 hash requires buffering
            entire blocks, and doing so defeats the purpose of the memory-efficient algorithm.

            If specified, upload_blob only succeeds if the

            If a date is passed in without timezone info, it is assumed to be UTC.

            A DateTime value. Azure expects the date value passed in to be UTC.
            If timezone is included, any non-UTC datetimes will be converted to UTC.
            If a date is passed in without timezone info, it is assumed to be UTC.
            Specify this header to perform the operation only if
            the resource has not been modified since the specified date/time.
        :keyword str etag:
            An ETag value, or the wildcard character (*). Used to check if the resource has changed,
            and act according to the condition specified by the `match_condition` parameter.
        :keyword ~azure.core.MatchConditions match_condition:
            The match condition to use upon the etag.

        :keyword ~azure.storage.blob.PremiumPageBlobTier premium_page_blob_tier:
            A page blob tier value to set the blob to. The tier correlates to the size of the
            blob and number of allowed IOPS. This is only applicable to page blobs on
            premium storage accounts.
        :keyword ~azure.storage.blob.StandardBlobTier standard_blob_tier:
            A standard blob tier value to set the blob to. For this version of the library,
            this is only applicable to block blobs on standard storage accounts.
        :keyword int maxsize_condition:
            Optional conditional header. The max length in bytes permitted for
            the append blob. If the Append Block operation would cause the blob
            to exceed that limit or if the blob size is already greater than the
            value specified in this header, the request will fail with
            MaxBlobSizeConditionNotMet error (HTTP status code 412 - Precondition Failed).

            64MB.
        :keyword ~azure.storage.blob.CustomerProvidedEncryptionKey cpk:
            Encrypts the data on the service-side with the given key.
            Use of customer-provided keys must be done over HTTPS.
            As the encryption key itself is provided in the request,
            a secure connection must be established to transfer the key.
        :keyword str encryption_scope:
            A predefined encryption scope used to encrypt the data on the service. An encryption
            scope can be created using the Management API and referenced here by name. If a default
            encryption scope has been defined at the container, this value will override it if the
            container-level scope is configured to allow overrides. Otherwise an error will be raised.

        :keyword str encoding:
            Defaults to UTF-8.
        :keyword int timeout:
            The timeout parameter is expressed in seconds. This method may make
            multiple calls to the Azure service and the timeout will apply to
            each call individually.

        This operation returns a copy operation
        object that can be used to wait on the completion of the operation,
        as well as check status or abort the copy operation.
        The Blob service copies blobs on a best-effort basis.

        The source blob for a copy operation may be a block blob, an append blob,
        or a page blob. If the destination blob already exists, it must be of the
        same blob type as the source blob. Any existing destination blob will be
        overwritten. The destination blob cannot be modified while a copy operation
        is in progress.

        When copying from a page blob, the Blob service creates a destination page
        blob of the source blob's length, initially containing all zeroes. Then
        the source page ranges are enumerated, and non-empty ranges are copied.

        For a block blob or an append blob, the Blob service creates a committed
        blob of zero length before returning from this operation. When copying
        from a block blob, all committed blocks and their block IDs are copied.
        Uncommitted blocks are not copied. At the end of the copy operation, the
        destination blob will have the same committed block count as the source.

        When copying from an append blob, all committed blocks are copied. At the
        end of the copy operation, the destination blob will have the same committed
        block count as the source.

        For all blob types, you can call status() on the returned polling object
        to check the status of the copy operation, or wait() to block until the
        operation is complete. The final blob will be committed when the copy completes.

        :param str source_url:
            A URL of up to 2 KB in length that specifies a file or blob.
            The value should be URL-encoded as it would appear in a request URI.
            If the source is in another account, the source must either be public
            or must be authenticated via a shared access signature. If the source
            is public, no authentication is required.
            Examples:
            https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob

            https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob?snapshot=<DateTime>

        :param metadata:
            Name-value pairs associated with the blob as metadata. If no name-value
            pairs are specified, the operation will copy the metadata from the
            source blob or file to the destination blob. If one or more name-value
            pairs are specified, the destination blob is created with the specified
            metadata, and metadata is not copied from the source blob or file.
        :type metadata: dict(str, str)
        :param bool incremental_copy:
            Copies the snapshot of the source page blob to a destination page blob.
            The snapshot is copied such that only the differential changes between
            the previously copied snapshot are transferred to the destination.
            The copied snapshots are complete copies of the original snapshot and
            can be read or copied from as usual. Defaults to False.
        :keyword tags:
            Name-value pairs associated with the blob as tag. Tags are case-sensitive.
            The tag set may contain at most 10 tags.  Tag keys must be between 1 and 128 characters,
            and tag values must be between 0 and 256 characters.
            Valid tag key and value characters include: lowercase and uppercase letters, digits (0-9),
