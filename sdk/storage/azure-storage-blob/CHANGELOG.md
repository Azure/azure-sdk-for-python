# Release History

## 12.19.0b1 (2023-10-17)

### Features Added
- Added support for service version 2023-11-03.
- Added `audience` as an optional keyword that can be specified on APIs that have a `credential` parameter. This
keyword only has an effect when the credential provided is of type `TokenCredential`.

### Bugs Fixed
- Deprecated `BlobProperties` as a valid input type to the `blob` parameter on the following APIs:
BlobServiceClient's `get_blob_client`, ContainerClient's `delete_blob`, `download_blob`, and `get_blob_client`.
This deprecation change also applies to the `name` parameter on ContainerClient's `upload_blob` API. This change
applies to both sync and async packages but does not apply to the batch equivalent of any of the listed APIs. If a
`BlobProperties` is provided, a deprecation warning is raised.

## 12.18.3 (2023-10-10)

### Bugs Fixed
- Fixed an issue when an invalid type was provided for `credential` during client construction, the
`__str__` of the object would be present in the exception message and therefore potentially logged.

## 12.18.2 (2023-09-25)

### Bugs Fixed
- Fixed an issue where `user_agent` was being ignored on `upload_blob` or `download_blob` if client was configured
for encryption.

## 12.18.1 (2023-09-13)

### Bugs Fixed
- Fixed breaking `KeyError: 'sdk_moniker'` in `create_configuration`.
NOTE: This is not an exported method and therefore should not be imported/called directly.

## 12.18.0 (2023-09-12)

### Features Added
- Stable release of features from 12.18.0b1

## 12.18.0b1 (2023-08-08)

### Features Added
- Added support for service versions 2023-05-03 and 2023-08-03.
- Added `version_id` as a client constructor parameter to `BlobClient`. This change makes `BlobClient`s version-aware, such that
all APIs that accept `version_id` will operate on the version ID provided during client construction by default.
- Added optional keyword `version_id` to `get_blob_client` APIs which, if provided, will result in a version-aware `BlobClient` in which
all APIs that accept `version_id` will operate on the version ID provided to the `get_blob_client` API call by default.

## 12.17.0 (2023-07-11)

### Features Added
- Stable release of features from 12.17.0b1

- The `download_blob` API now returns `creation_time` on the download response.

## 12.15.0b1 (2023-02-02)

### Features Added
- Added support for service version 2021-12-02.
- Added support for new blob tier, `Cold`.
- Added support for `AsyncIterable` as data type for async blob upload.

### Bugs Fixed
- Changed how async streams are detected on async `upload_blob` to increase compatiblity with different types.

### Other Changes
- Removed `msrest` dependency.
- Added `typing-extensions>=4.0.1` as a dependency.
- Added `isodate>=0.6.1` as a dependency.

## 12.14.1 (2022-10-18)

### Bugs Fixed
- Fixed possible `ValueError` for invalid content range that gets raised when downloading empty blobs through Azurite.

## 12.14.0 (2022-10-11)

### Features Added
- Stable release of features from 12.14.0b1 and 12.14.0b2.

### Bugs Fixed
- Fixed an issue where calling `download_blob` with an invalid base64-encoded account key would cause an
`AttributeError` rather than the proper `AzureSigningError`.

### Other Changes
- Changed the default value for `read_timeout` to 60 seconds for all clients.

## 12.14.0b2 (2022-08-30)

### Features Added
- Added a new API, `list_blob_names`, to `ContainerClient` that lists only the names of the blobs in the respective
container. This API is significantly faster than the traditional `list_blobs` and can be used if only the blob names
are desired. It does not return any additional properties or metadata for the blobs.

## 12.14.0b1 (2022-08-23)

This version and all future versions will require Python 3.7+. Python 3.6 is no longer supported.

### Features Added
- Added support for `AzureNamedKeyCredential` as a valid `credential` type.
- Added standard `read` method to `StorageStreamDownloader`.
- Added support for async streams (classes with an async `read` method) to async `upload_blob`.

### Bugs Fixed
- Removed dead retry meachism from async `azure.storage.blob.aio.StorageStreamDownloader`.
- Updated exception catching of `azure.storage.blob.StorageStreamDownloader`'s retry mechanism.
- Adjusted type hints for `upload_blob` and `StorageStreamDownloader.readall`.
- Fixed a bug where uploading an empty blob via `upload_blob` would fail with `validate_content=True`.

## 12.13.0 (2022-07-07)

### Bugs Fixed
- Stable release of features from 12.13.0b1.
- Added support for deleting versions in `delete_blobs` by supplying `version_id`.

## 12.13.0b1 (2022-06-15)

### Features Added
- Added support for service version 2021-08-06.
- Added a new version of client-side encryption for blobs (version 2.0) which utilizes AES-GCM-256 encryption.
If you are currently using client-side encryption, it is **highly recommended** to switch to a form of server-side
encryption (Customer-Provided Key, Encryption Scope, etc.) or version 2.0 of client-side encryption. The encryption
version can be specified on any client constructor via the `encryption_version` keyword (`encryption_version='2.0'`).

## 12.12.0 (2022-05-09)

### Features Added
- Stable release of features from 12.12.0b1.
- Added support for progress tracking to `upload_blob()` and `download_blob()` via a new optional callback,`progress_hook`.

### Bugs Fixed
- Fixed a bug in `BlobClient.from_blob_url()` such that users will receive a more helpful error
message if they pass an incorrect URL without a full `/container/blob` path.
- Fixed a bug, introduced in the previous beta release, that caused Authentication errors when attempting to use
an Account SAS with certain service level operations.

## 12.12.0b1 (2022-04-14)

### Features Added
- Added support for service version 2021-06-08.
- Added a new paginated method for listing page ranges, `list_page_ranges()`. This replaces `get_page_ranges()` which has been deprecated.
- Added support for copying source blob tags with `start_copy_from_url()` by specifying `"COPY"` for the `tags` keyword.

## 12.11.0 (2022-03-29)

**Warning** This release involves a bug fix that may change the behavior for some users. In previous versions,
the `tag` parameter on`BlobSasPermissions` defaulted to `True` meaning a Blob SAS URL would include the `t` permission
by default. This was not the intended behavior. This release adjusts `BlobSasPermission` so the `tag` permission will
default to `False`, like all other permissions.

### Bugs Fixed
- Fixed a bug in `BlobSasPermissions` where the `tag` permission had a default value of `True` and
therefore was being added to the SAS token by default.

## 12.10.0 (2022-03-08)

This version and all future versions will require Python 3.6+. Python 2.7 is no longer supported.

## 12.0.0 (2019-10-31)

**Breaking changes**

- `set_container_access_policy` has required parameter `signed_identifiers`.
- `NoRetry` policy has been removed. Use keyword argument `retry_total=0` for no retries.
- `StorageStreamDownloader` is no longer iterable. To iterate over the blob data stream, use `StorageStreamDownloader.chunks`.
- The public attributes of `StorageStreamDownloader` have been limited to:
  - `name` (str): The name of the blob.
  - `container` (str): The container the blob is being downloaded from.
  - `properties` (`BlobProperties`): The properties of the blob.
  - `size` (int): The size of the download. Either the total blob size, or the length of a subsection if sepcified. Previously called `download_size`.
- `StorageStreamDownloader` now has new functions:
  - `readall()`: Reads the complete download stream, returning bytes. This replaces the functions `content_as_bytes` and `content_as_text` which have been deprecated.
  - `readinto(stream)`: Download the complete stream into the supplied writable stream, returning the number of bytes written. This replaces the function `download_to_stream` which has been deprecated.
- Module level functions `upload_blob_to_url` and `download_blob_from_url` functions options are now keyword only:
  - `overwrite`
  - `max_concurrency`
  - `encoding`
- Removed types that were accidentally exposed from two modules. Only `BlobServiceClient`, `ContainerClient`,
`BlobClient` and `BlobLeaseClient` should be imported from azure.storage.blob.aio
- `Logging` has been renamed to `BlobAnalyticsLogging`.
- Client and model files have been made internal. Users should import from the top level modules `azure.storage.blob` and `azure.storage.blob.aio` only.
- All operations that take Etag conditional parameters (`if_match` and `if_none_match`) now take explicit `etag` and `match_condition` parameters, where `etag` is the Etag value, and `match_condition` is an instance of `azure.core.MatchConditions`.
- The `generate_shared_access_signature` methods on each of `BlobServiceClient`, `ContainerClient` and `BlobClient` have been replaced by module level functions `generate_account_sas`, `generate_container_sas` and `generate_blob_sas`.
- The batch APIs now have an additional keyword only argument `raise_on_any_failure` which defaults to True. This will raise an error even if there's a partial batch failure.
- `LeaseClient` has been renamed to `BlobLeaseClient`.
- `get_service_stats` now returns a dict
- `get_service_properties` now returns a dict with keys consistent to `set_service_properties`

**New features**

- Added async module-level `upload_blob_to_url` and `download_blob_from_url` functions.
- `ResourceTypes`, and `Services` now have method `from_string` which takes parameters as a string.

## 12.0.0b4 (2019-10-08)

**Breaking changes**

- Permission models.
  - `AccountPermissions`, `BlobPermissions` and `ContainerPermissions` have been renamed to
  `AccountSasPermissions`, `BlobSasPermissions` and `ContainerSasPermissions` respectively.
  - enum-like list parameters have been removed from all three of them.
  - `__add__` and `__or__` methods are removed.
- `max_connections` is now renamed to `max_concurrency`.
- `ContainerClient` now accepts only `account_url` with a mandatory string param `container_name`.
To use a container_url, the method `from_container_url` must be used.
- `BlobClient` now accepts only `account_url` with mandatory string params `container_name` and
`blob_name`. To use a blob_url, the method `from_blob_url` must be used.
- Some parameters have become keyword only, rather than positional. Some examples include:
  - `loop`
  - `max_concurrency`
  - `validate_content`
  - `timeout` etc.
- APIs now take in `offset` and `length` instead of `range_start` and `range_end` consistently.
`length` is the number of bytes to take in starting from the `offset`. The APIs that have been
changed include:
  - `get_page_ranges`
  - `upload_page`
  - `upload_pages_from_url`
  - `clear_page`
  - `append_block_from_url`
- `block_id` is not optional in `BlobBlock` model.

- Added blob tier support for Block Blob, including Upload Blob/Commit Block List/Copy Blob APIs.
- `AccountSasPermissions`, `BlobSasPermissions`, `ContainerSasPermissions` now have method `from_string`
which takes parameters as a string.

**Fixes and improvements**
- Downloading page blobs now take advantage of their sparseness.
- The `length` param in `download_blob` now takes the number of bytes to take in starting from the `offset`
instead of a harde set end value.

**Dependency updates**
- Adopted [azure-core](https://pypi.org/project/azure-core/) 1.0.0b4
  - If you later want to revert to previous versions of azure-storage-blob, or another Azure SDK
  library requiring azure-core 1.0.0b1 or azure-core 1.0.0b2, you must explicitly install
  the specific version of azure-core as well. For example:

  `pip install azure-core==1.0.0b2 azure-storage-blob==12.0.0b2`

## 12.0.0b3 (2019-09-10)

- Added `abort_copy` operation to the `BlobClient` class. This replaces the previous abort operation on the copy status polling operation.
- The behavior of listing operations has been modified:
    - The previous `marker` parameter has been removed.
    - The iterable response object now supports a `by_page` function that will return a secondary iterator of batches of results. This function supports a `continuation_token` parameter to replace the previous `marker` parameter.
- Some parameters have become keyword only, rather than positional. Some examples include:
    - `timeout`
    - `lease`
    - `encoding`
    - Modification conditions, e.g. `if_modified_since`, `if_match` , `maxsize_condition`, etc

**Fixes and improvements**
- Fix for SAS URL encoding (#6500)
- General refactor of duplicate and shared code.


## 12.0.0b1 (2019-07-02)

Version 12.0.0b1 is the first preview of our efforts to create a user-friendly and Pythonic client library for Azure Storage Blobs. For more information about this, and preview releases of other Azure SDK libraries, please visit
https://aka.ms/azure-sdk-preview1-python.

**Breaking changes: New API design**
- Operations are now scoped to a particular client:
    - `BlobServiceClient`: This client handles account-level operations. This includes managing service properties and listing the containers within an account.
    - `ContainerClient`: The client handles operations for a particular container. This includes creating or deleting that container, as well as listing the blobs within that container and managing properties and metadata.
    - `BlobClient`: The client handles operations for a particular blob. This includes creating or deleting that blob, as well as upload and download data and managing properties.
    This BlobClient handles all blob types (block, page and append). Where operations can behave differently according to type (i.e. `upload_blob`) the default behaviour will be block blobs unless otherwise specified.
    - `LeaseClient`: Handles all lease operations for both containers and blobs.

    These clients can be accessed by navigating down the client hierarchy, or instantiated directly using URLs to the resource (account, container or blob).
    For full details on the new API, please see the [reference documentation](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-python/storage.html#azure-storage-blob).
- Copy blob operations now return a polling object that can be used to check the status of the operation, as well as abort the operation.
- New module level operations for simple upload and download using a blob URL.
- Download operations now return a streaming object that can download data in multiple ways:
    - Iteration: The streamer is an iterable object that will download and yield the content in chunks. Only supports single threaded download.
    - `content_as_bytes`: Return the entire blob content as bytes. Blocking operation that supports multi-threaded download.
    - `content_as_text`: Return the entire blob content as decoded text. Blocking operation that supports multi-threaded download.
    - `download_to_stream`: Download the entire content to an open stream handle (e.g. an open file). Supports multi-threaded download.
- New underlying REST pipeline implementation, based on the new `azure-core` library.
- Client and pipeline configuration is now available via keyword arguments at both the client level, and per-operation. See reference documentation for a full list of optional configuration arguments.
- Authentication using `azure-identity` credentials
  - see the
  [Azure Identity documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/identity/azure-identity/README.md)
  for more information
- New error hierarchy:
    - All service errors will now use the base type: `azure.core.exceptions.HttpResponseError`
    - The are a couple of specific exception types derived from this base type for common error scenarios:
        - `ResourceNotFoundError`: The resource (e.g. queue, message) could not be found. Commonly a 404 status code.
        - `ResourceExistsError`: A resource conflict - commonly caused when attempting to create a resource that already exists.
        - `ResourceModifiedError`: The resource has been modified (e.g. overwritten) and therefore the current operation is in conflict. Alternatively this may be raised if a condition on the operation is not met.
        - `ClientAuthenticationError`: Authentication failed.
- Operation `set_blob_properties` has been renamed to `set_http_headers`.
- Operations `get_blob_to_<output>` have been replaced with `download_blob`. See above for download output options.
- Operations `create_blob_from_<input>` have been replace with `upload_blob`.
- Operation `create_blob` has been renamed to separate `create_page_blob` and `create_append_blob`.
- Operations `get_container_acl` and `set_container_acl` have been renamed to `get_container_access_policy` and `set_container_access_policy`.
- Operation `snapshot_blob` has been renamed to `create_snapshot`.
- Operation `copy_blob` has been renamed to `copy_blob_from_url`.
- Operations `put_block` and `put_block_from_url` have been renamed to `stage_block` and `stage_block_from_url`.
- Operation `put_block_list` has been renamed to `commit_block_list`.
- No longer have specific operations for `get_metadata` - use `get_properties` instead.
- No longer have specific operations for `exists` - use `get_properties` instead.
- Operation `incremental_copy_blob` has been replaced by an optional boolean flag in the `copy_blob_from_url` operation.
- Operation `update_page` has been renamed to `upload_page`.
- Operation `get_page_ranges_diff` has been replaced by an optional str flag in the `get_page_ranges` operation.

## 2.0.1

- Updated dependency on azure-storage-common.

## 2.0.0

- Support for 2018-11-09 REST version. Please see our REST API documentation and blog for information about the related added features.
- Added support for append block from URL(synchronously) for append blobs.
- Added support for update page from URL(synchronously) for page blobs.
- Added support for generating and using blob snapshot SAS tokens.
- Added support for generating user delegation SAS tokens.

## 1.5.0

- Added new method list_blob_names to efficiently list only blob names in an efficient way.

## 1.4.0

- azure-storage-nspkg is not installed anymore on Python 3 (PEP420-based namespace package)
- copy_blob method added to BlockBlobService to enable support for deep sync copy.

## 1.3.1

- Fixed design flaw where get_blob_to_* methods buffer entire blob when max_connections is set to 1.
- Added support for access conditions on append_blob_from_* methods.

## 1.3.0

- Support for 2018-03-28 REST version. Please see our REST API documentation and blog for information about the related added features.
- Added support for setting static website service properties.
- Added support for getting account information, such as SKU name and account kind.
- Added support for put block from URL(synchronously).

## 1.2.0rc1

- Support for 2017-11-09 REST version. Please see our REST API documentation and blog for information about the related added features.
- Support for write-once read-many containers.
- Added support for OAuth authentication for HTTPS requests(Please note that this feature is available in preview).

## 1.1.0

- Support for 2017-07-29 REST version. Please see our REST API documentation and blogs for information about the related added features.
- Added support for soft delete feature. If a delete retention policy is enabled through the set service properties API, then blobs or snapshots could be deleted softly and retained for a specified number of days, before being permanently removed by garbage collection.
- Error message now contains the ErrorCode from the x-ms-error-code header value.

## 1.0.0

- The package has switched from Apache 2.0 to the MIT license.
- Fixed bug where get_blob_to_* cannot get a single byte when start_range and end_range are both equal to 0.
- Optimized page blob upload for create_blob_from_* methods, by skipping the empty chunks.
- Added convenient method to generate container url (make_container_url).
- Metadata keys are now case-preserving when fetched from the service. Previously they were made lower-case by the library.

## 0.37.1

- Enabling MD5 validation no longer uses the memory-efficient algorithm for large block blobs, since computing the MD5 hash requires reading the entire block into memory.
- Fixed a bug in the _SubStream class which was at risk of causing data corruption when using the memory-efficient algorithm for large block blobs.
- Support for AccessTierChangeTime to get the last time a tier was modified on an individual blob.
