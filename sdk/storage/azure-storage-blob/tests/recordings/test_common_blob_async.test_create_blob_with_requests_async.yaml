        \                               PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is hoped that the great
        variety of new, useful, curious and\r\nentertaining articles which will be
        found in the following work, will\r\nentitle it to a favourable reception
        from the public. No pains nor\r\nexpence have been spared to give it as much
        accuracy and perfection as\r\nthe nature of such a work will admit of. And
        though we do not flatter\r\nourselves that it will be absolutely free from
        errors or imperfections,\r\nyet we doubt not but the candid reader will find
        so much to commend,\r\nthat he will easily be inclined to excuse some unavoidable
        deficiencies.\r\n\r\nThe Environs of London, though they contain many of the
        most remarkable\r\nseats and places in the kingdom, have never before been
        included in any\r\naccount of that metropolis; and we are persuaded, that
        the most\r\nintelligent enquirer will here find numberless curiosities, not
        hitherto\r\ntaken notice of by any other writers: besides, we have not only
        been\r\nparticular in our descriptions of whatever is remarkable twenty miles\r\nround;
        but to assist his observation, we have added a map, which we\r\nflatter ourselves
        will be found to have some advantages over any other\r\nthat has yet appeared.
        This map, and these descriptions, will serve both\r\nas a guide and an instructor
        to the travelling Virtuosi, whether natives\r\nor foreigners, in their little
        excursions to any part of these\r\ndelightfully adorned and richly cultivated
        environs.\r\n\r\nIn order to render the knowledge of this metropolis as complete
        as\r\npossible, we have necessarily been obliged, in conformity with our plan,\r\nto
        treat of what may to some appear little and uninteresting, as well as\r\nof
        what is great and important. Among these the citizens are\r\nparticularly
        interested in knowing the extent and limits of the wards in\r\nwhich they
        reside: and it was absolutely necessary to mention in their\r\nproper places
        all the several companies that compose their whole body:\r\nand as every inhabitant
        of the kingdom may, at one time or another, have\r\noccasion to visit or write
        to their friends or relations residing in\r\nthis great city, the names and
        situation of all the several streets,\r\nlanes, rows, courts, yards and allies
        could not be omitted. With regard\r\nto these an ingenious gentleman has furnished
        us with a key, which has\r\nlet us into the origin of many of their names;
        and this part of our work\r\nis farther illustrated by a new and correct plan.\r\n\r\nThe
        prints with which the whole is decorated, are all engraved by the\r\nbest
        hands, after original drawings, which were taken on purpose for\r\nthis work,
        from the several objects themselves, at a very great expence;\r\nand we imagine
        they will not only be considered as an ornament, but that\r\nthey will be
        found of use in illustrating the verbal descriptions.\r\n\r\nWe beg leave
        in this place to make our grateful acknowledgments to\r\nseveral of the nobility
        and gentry, who have been pleased to favour us\r\non this occasion with lists
        and accounts of their pictures, curiosities,\r\n&c. which have greatly enriched
        and added a value to our work; and being\r\nentirely new, cannot but be acceptable
        to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _S. Wale delin._ _J. Green sc. Oxon._

        \                                  A\r\n\r\n\r\nABBEY _Church of St. Peter\u2019s,
        Westminster_. Many have been the fables\r\ninvented and propagated by the
        monks, relating to the original\r\nfoundation of this ancient edifice; but
        the most probable account is\r\ngiven by those who place it under Sebert,
        King of the East Saxons, who\r\ndied in 616. These say, that this Prince being
        converted to christianity\r\nby Austin\u2019s discourses, and his uncle Ethelbert\u2019s
        example, erected this\r\nchurch on the ruins of a temple dedicated to Apollo,
        in the island of\r\nThorney, and caused Mellitus, Bishop of London, to consecrate
        it to St.\r\nPeter.\r\n\r\nAs many ridiculous miracles have been related of
        its foundation, it is\r\nthe less surprizing that its dedication should also
        be represented as\r\nmiraculous, and that St. Peter himself, five hundred
        years after his\r\ndecease, should be represented by the monks, as doing honour
        to the new\r\nfabric, by performing the ceremony himself. For according to
        the legend,\r\nthe King having ordered Mellitus to perform the ceremony, St.
        Peter\r\nover-night called upon Edricus, a fisherman, and desired to be ferried\r\nover
        to Thorney, which happened to be then overflowed by the heavy rains\r\nthat
        had lately fallen; the fisherman consented, and having carried over\r\nthe
        Apostle, he saw him consecrate the church amidst a grand chorus of\r\ncelestial
        music, and a glorious appearance of heavenly lights. After\r\nwhich the Apostle
        returning, discovered himself to the fisherman, and\r\nbid him tell Mellitus
        what he had heard and seen, and as a proof of his\r\ndivine mission, gave
        him a miraculous draught of salmon, and then\r\nassured him, that none of
        his profession should ever want that kind of\r\nfish in the proper season,
        provided they made an offering of the tenth\r\nfish for the use of the new
        church; which custom, it seems, was\r\ncontinued by the fishermen four hundred
        years after.\r\n\r\nThis church and its monastery were afterwards repaired
        and enlarged by\r\nOffa, King of Mercia, but being destroyed by the Pagan
        Danes, they were\r\nrebuilt by King Edgar, who endowed them with lands and
        manors, and in\r\nthe year 969 granted them many ample privileges.\r\n\r\nThe
        church and monastery having again suffered by the ravages of the\r\nDanes,
        were again rebuilt by Edward the Confessor, who pulled down the\r\nold church,
        and erected a most magnificent one, for that age, in its\r\nroom, in the form
        of a cross, which afterwards became a pattern for that\r\nkind of building.
        The work being finished in the year 1065, he caused it\r\nto be consecrated
        with the greatest pomp and solemnity, and by several\r\ncharters not only
        confirmed all its ancient rights and privileges, but\r\nendowed it with many
        rich manors, and additional immunities: ordained\r\nthat all its lands and
        possessions, should be subject to none but its\r\nown jurisdiction, and the
        convent be free from the authority of the\r\nBishop of London; and the church,
        by a bull of Pope Nicholas I. was\r\nconstituted the place for the inauguration
        of the Kings of England. In\r\nshort, he gave it a charter of sanctuary, in
        which he declares, that any\r\nperson whatsoever, let his crimes be ever so
        great, who takes sanctuary\r\nin that holy place, shall be assured of life,
        liberty, and limbs, and\r\nthat none of his ministers, nor those of his successors,
        should seize\r\nany of his goods, lands or possessions, under pain of everlasting\r\ndamnation,
        and that whoever presumed to act contrary to this grant,\r\nshould lose his
        name, worship, dignity, and power, and with the traitor\r\nJudas, be in the
        everlasting fire of hell. This was the pious language\r\nof St. Edward the
        Confessor, and from this charter, Westminster Abbey\r\nbecame an asylum for
        traitors, murderers, robbers, and the most\r\nabandoned miscreants, who lived
        there in open defiance of the laws.\r\n\r\nThis, and King Edward\u2019s other
        charters, in which he recites the\r\nridiculous story of its consecration
        by St. Peter, as above related, its\r\ndestruction by the Danes, the grants
        and privileges of his predecessors,\r\nand those bestowed by himself, drew
        people thither from all parts, so\r\nthat in a short time there was not sufficient
        room in the Abbey church\r\nfor the accommodation of the numerous inhabitants,
        without incommoding\r\nthe monks; he therefore caused a church to be erected
        on the north side\r\nof the monastery, for the use of the inhabitants, and
        dedicated it to\r\nSt. Margaret.\r\n\r\nWilliam the Conqueror, to shew his
        regard to the memory of his late\r\nfriend King Edward, no sooner arrived
        in London, than he repaired to\r\nthis church, and offered a sumptuous pall,
        as a covering for his tomb;\r\nhe also gave fifty marks of silver, together
        with a very rich altar\r\ncloth, and two caskets of gold; and the Christmas
        following was solemnly\r\ncrowned there, his being the first coronation performed
        in that place.\r\n\r\nThe next Prince who improved this great work, was Henry
        III. who in the\r\nyear 1200 began to erect a new chapel to the blessed Virgin;
        but about\r\ntwenty years after, finding the walls and steeple of the old
        structure\r\nmuch decayed, he pulled them all down, with a design to enlarge,
        and\r\nrebuild them in a more regular manner; but he did not live to accomplish\r\nthis
        great work, which was not compleated till 1285, about fourteen\r\nyears after
        his decease. And this is the date of the building as it now\r\nstands.\r\n\r\nAbout
        the year 1502, King Henry began that magnificent structure which\r\nis now
        generally called by his name; for this purpose, he pulled down\r\nthe chapel
        of Henry III. already mentioned, and an adjoining house\r\ncalled the White
        Rose Tavern; this chapel, like the former, he dedicated\r\nto the blessed
        Virgin, and designing it for a burial place for himself\r\nand his posterity,
        he carefully ordered in his will, that none but those\r\nof royal blood should
        be permitted to lie there.\r\n\r\nAt length on the general suppression of
        religious houses, the Abbey was\r\nsurrendered to Henry VIII. by William Benson,
        the Abbot, and seventeen\r\nof the monks, in the year 1539, when its revenues
        amounted to 3977_l._\r\n6_s._ 4_d._ \xBE _per annum_, a sum at least equal
        to 20,000_l._ a year at\r\npresent. Besides its furniture, which was of inestimable
        value, it had\r\nin different parts of the kingdom, no less than two hundred,
        and sixteen\r\nmanors, seventeen hamlets, and ninety-seven towns and villages.
        And tho\u2019\r\nthe Abbey was only the second in rank, yet in all other respects
        it was\r\nthe chief in the kingdom; and its Abbots having episcopal jurisdiction,\r\nhad
        a seat in the house of Lords.\r\n\r\nThe Abbey thus dissolved, that Prince
        erected first into a college of\r\nsecular Canons, under the government of
        a Dean, an honour which he chose\r\nto confer on the last Abbot. This establishment,
        however, was of no long\r\nduration, for two years after he converted it into
        a bishopric, which\r\nwas dissolved nine years after by Edward VI. who restored
        the government\r\nby a Dean, which continued till Mary\u2019s accession to
        the crown; when she,\r\nin 1557, restored it to its ancient conventual state;
        but Queen\r\nElizabeth again ejected the monks, and in 1560 erected Westminster
        Abbey\r\ninto a college, under the government of a Dean, and twelve secular\r\nCanons
        or Prebendaries, a Schoolmaster, Usher, and forty Scholars,\r\ndenominated
        the Queen\u2019s, to be educated in the liberal sciences\r\npreparatory to
        the university, and to have all the necessaries of life,\r\nexcept cloathing,
        of which they were to have only a gown every year. To\r\nthis foundation also
        belong choristers, singing-men, an organist, twelve\r\nalmsmen, &c.\r\n\r\nThe
        Abbey church, which was stripped of many of its decorations by Henry\r\nVIII.
        and was much damaged both within and without during the unhappy\r\ncivil commotions
        that defaced the ancient beauty of most of the\r\nreligious houses in this
        kingdom, has continued from the death of Henry\r\nVII. almost to the present
        time, without any other considerable repairs,\r\nand was gradually falling
        to ruin, when the Parliament interposed, and\r\nordered a thorough reparation
        at the national expence.\r\n\r\nThis venerable fabric has been accordingly
        new coated on the outside,\r\nexcept that part called Henry the Seventh\u2019s
        chapel, which is indeed a\r\nseparate building: and the west end has been
        adorned with two new\r\nstately towers that have been lately rebuilt, in such
        a manner as to be\r\nthought equal in point of workmanship to any part of
        the ancient\r\nbuilding; but though such pains have been taken in the coating,
        to\r\npreserve the ancient Gothic grandeur, that this church in its distant\r\nprospect
        has all the venerable majesty of its former state, yet the\r\nbeautiful carving
        with which it was once adorned, is irretrievably lost;\r\nthe buttresses,
        once capped with turrets, are now made in plain\r\npyramidical forms, and
        topped with freestone; and the statues of our\r\nancient Kings that formerly
        stood in niches, near the tops of those\r\nbuttresses, are for the most part
        removed, and their broken fragments\r\nlodged in the roof of Henry the Seventh\u2019s
        chapel. Three of these statues\r\nare still standing next the towers on the
        north side, and indeed that is\r\nthe only side where you can take a view
        of the Abbey, the other side\r\nbeing so incumbered with buildings, that even
        its situation cannot be\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nWhat next to the new towers
        principally engages the attention on the\r\noutside, is the Gothic portico
        which leads into the north cross, which\r\nby some has been stiled _the Beautiful_,
        or _Solomon\u2019s Gate_. This was\r\nprobably built by Richard II. as his
        arms carved in stone was formerly\r\nover the gate. It has been lately beautified,
        and over it is a new\r\nwindow admirably well executed. Besides these there
        is little in the\r\noutward appearance capable of engaging the attention,
        and its principal\r\nbeauties are to be found within.\r\n\r\nThe author of
        the work entitled _English Architecture_, seems to prefer\r\nthe Gothic to
        the Grecian architecture, as most suited to the purposes\r\nof devotion, and
        gives this edifice as an instance, \u201CThere is in it,\r\nsays he, a majesty
        and grandeur, a sedate, and if we may so speak,\r\nreligious dignity, which
        immediately strikes the imagination; and never\r\nfailed to impress on the
        most insensible observer, that holy awe which\r\nshould attend, and which
        always disposes the mind to devotion.\u201D But this\r\nholy awe, thus mechanically
        incited, would be as friendly to Paganism as\r\nto Christianity; and indeed,
        this awe is so far from being holy, that it\r\nis a thing entirely distinct
        from rational piety and devotion, and may\r\nbe felt without any inclination
        to enter the choir.\r\n\r\nIndeed the multiplicity of puerile ornaments profusely
        lavished, the\r\nstrong and beautiful perspective, and that romantic air of
        grandeur so\r\nvisible in this structure, and above all the height of the
        middle isle\r\nat our first entrance, fill the eye, strike us in a very forcible\r\nmanner,
        and at once raise our admiration and astonishment. To which let\r\nit be added,
        that the ranges of venerable monuments on each hand, some\r\nof them most
        magnificent, have a natural tendency to strike the mind\r\nwith an uncommon
        degree of solemnity, and to raise the most serious\r\nreflections.\r\n\r\nThe
        extent of the building is very considerable; for it is 360 feet\r\nwithin
        the walls, at the nave it is 72 feet broad, and at the cross 195.\r\nThe Gothic
        arches and side isles are supported by 48 pillars of grey\r\nmarble, each
        composed of clusters of very slender ones, and covered with\r\nornaments.
        The moment you enter the west door the whole body of the\r\nchurch opens itself
        at once to your view, the pillars dividing the nave\r\nfrom the side isles
        being so formed as not to obstruct the side\r\nopenings, nor is your sight
        terminated to the east, but by the fine\r\npainted window over Edward the
        Confessor\u2019s chapel, which anciently, when\r\nthe altar was low, and adorned
        with the beautiful shrine of that\r\npretended saint, must have afforded one
        of the finest prospects that can\r\nbe imagined.\r\n\r\nThe pillars are terminated
        to the east by a sweep, enclosing the chapel\r\nof Edward the Confessor, in
        a kind of semicircle. And it is worthy of\r\nobservation, that as far as the
        gates of the choir, the pillars are\r\nfilletted with brass, but all beyond
        with stone. Answering to the middle\r\nrange of pillars, there are others
        in the wall, which as they rise,\r\nspring into semiarches, and are every
        where met in acute angles by their\r\nopposites, and meeting in the roof are
        adorned with a variety of\r\ncarvings. On the arches of the pillars are galleries
        of double columns\r\nfifteen feet wide, covering the side isles, and enlightened
        by a middle\r\nrange of windows, over which there is an upper range of larger
        windows,\r\nand by these, together with the four capital windows, facing the
        north,\r\neast, south and west, the whole fabric is so admirably enlightened,
        that\r\nin the day you are never dazzled with its brightness, nor incommoded
        by\r\nits being too dark. But before we leave these capital windows, which
        are\r\nall finely painted, it is necessary to observe, that in the great west\r\nwindow
        is a curious painting of Edward III. to the left of which in a\r\nsmaller
        window is a painting of one of our Kings, supposed to be Richard\r\nII. but
        the colours being of a water blue the features of the face\r\ncannot be distinguished.
        On the other side the great window is a lively\r\nrepresentation of Edward
        the Confessor in his robes, and under his feet\r\nare painted his arms. At
        the bottom of the walls between the pillars are\r\nshallow niches, arched
        about eight or ten feet high, on which the arms\r\nof the original benefactors
        are depicted, and over them are their\r\ntitles, &c. but these are almost
        all concealed by the monuments of the\r\ndead placed before them, many of
        which are extremely noble, and which we\r\nshall particularly examine after
        having gone through the several parts\r\nof the edifice.\r\n\r\nAfter viewing
        the open part of the church, the next thing to be seen is\r\nthe choir, which
        can only be done during the times of divine service.\r\nThe grand entrance
        into it is by a pair of fine iron gates, on each side\r\nof which is a very
        magnificent tomb. The floor is paved with the finest\r\nblack and white marble.
        The ancient stalls are covered with Gothic acute\r\narches, supported by small
        iron pillars, and are painted purple; but\r\nwhat is most worthy of observation,
        is an ancient portrait near the\r\npulpit, of Richard II. sitting in a gilt
        chair, dressed in a green vest\r\nflowered with gold, with gold shoes powdered
        with pearls. This piece is\r\nsix feet eleven inches in length, and three
        feet seven inches in\r\nbreadth; but the lower part is much defaced.\r\n\r\nThe
        next thing worthy of observation is the fine altar enclos\u2019d with a\r\ncurious
        balustrade, within which is a pavement of mosaic work, laid at\r\nthe expence
        of Abbot Ware, in the year 1272, and is said to be one of\r\nthe most beautiful
        of its kind in the world: the stones of which it is\r\ncomposed are porphyry,
        jasper, lydian and serpentine. The altar is a\r\nbeautiful piece of marble,
        removed from Whitehall, and presented to this\r\nchurch by order of her majesty
        Queen Anne. On each side of the altar are\r\ndoors, opening into St. Edward\u2019s
        chapel.\r\n\r\n_Of the several Chapels in Westminster Abbey._ Besides that
        of Henry\r\nVII. which, as we have already observed, is a separate building,
        and\r\nwill therefore be mentioned by itself when we have finished our survey\r\nof
        the Abbey, there are ten chapels, round that of St. Edward the\r\nConfessor,
        which stands as it were in the center, and, as has been said,\r\nis inclosed
        in the body of the church, at the east end of the choir,\r\nbehind the altar;
        these, beginning from the north cross, and passing\r\nround to the south cross,
        are in the following order: St. Andrew\u2019s, St.\r\nMichael\u2019s, St.
        John the Evangelist\u2019s, Islip\u2019s chapel, St. John the\r\nBaptist\u2019s,
        St. Paul\u2019s, Henry the Fifth\u2019s, St. Nicholas\u2019s, St. Edmund\u2019s,\r\nand
        St. Benedict\u2019s.\r\n\r\n_The Chapel of St. Edward._ The first curiosity
        that here fixes our\r\nattention, is the ancient shrine erected by Henry III.
        upon the\r\ncanonization of Edward King of England, the third of that name
        before\r\nthe conquest, and the last of the Saxon race; a Prince who owed
        the\r\ntitle of Confessor and Saint, to the vast sums he bestowed on the\r\nchurch,
        and the sollicitations of the monks, than to his own personal\r\nmerit: for
        he was a bad son, a bad husband, and so bad a king, that he\r\nshewed greater
        favour to the Normans than to his own people, and by his\r\nfolly prepared
        the way for the conquest. He died in the year 1066, and\r\nwas canonized by
        Pope Alexander III. in 1269. This shrine, which was\r\nonce esteemed the glory
        of England, is now much defaced and neglected.\r\nIt was composed of stones
        of various colours, beautifully enriched with\r\nall the cost that art could
        devise. No sooner was it erected, than the\r\nwealth of the kingdom flowed
        to it from all quarters. Henry III. set the\r\nfirst example, though he afterwards
        made use of the jewels and treasure\r\nhe offered there, to defray the charges
        of an expedition into France.\r\nBefore this shrine was a lamp kept continually
        burning, on one side\r\nstood a silver image of the blessed Virgin, which
        with two jewels of\r\nimmense value, were presented by Queen Eleanor, the
        wife of Henry III.\r\non the other side stood another image of the Virgin
        Mary, wrought in\r\nivory, presented by Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury.
        Here also\r\nEdward I. offered the Scots regalia and chair, in which the kings
        of\r\nScotland used to be crowned, which is still preserved and shewn to all\r\nstrangers.
        And about the year 1280, Alphonso, third son to the last\r\nmentioned king,
        offered here the golden coronet of Llewellyn, Prince of\r\nWales, and other
        jewels; but it would almost fill a volume to enumerate\r\nthe offerings made
        at this shrine. Yet it is now so stripped as to\r\nafford no satisfaction,
        except to the curious; however some of the\r\nstone-work with which it is
        adorned, is still to be seen. This\r\nstone-work is hollow within, and now
        incloses a large chest, which Mr.\r\nKeep, soon after the coronation of James
        II. found to contain the\r\nremains of St. Edward; for it being broken by
        accident, he discovered a\r\nnumber of bones, and turning them up, found a
        crucifix, richly\r\nornamented and enamell\u2019d with a gold chain of twenty
        inches long, both\r\nwhich he presented to his Majesty, who ordered the bones
        to be replaced\r\nin the old coffin, and enclosed in a new one made very strong,
        and\r\nclamp\u2019d with iron.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of this shrine lies
        Editha, daughter to Goodwyn, Earl\r\nof Kent, and Queen to St. Edward, with
        whom she lived eighteen years,\r\nand tho\u2019 she was the most accomplished
        woman of that age, confessed on\r\nher death-bed, that he suffered her to
        live and die a virgin; and, as an\r\nancient manuscript in the Cotton library
        has it, \u201Cnathelees, tho\u2019 the\r\nKinge had a wyfe, he lived ev\u2019moe
        in chastete, and clennes, wythowten\r\nany fleshley dedes doynge wyth his
        wyfe the Queen, and so dyd the Queen\r\non her syde.\u201D She survived her
        husband eight years, and beheld all the\r\nmiseries consequent upon his dying
        without issue. She was however\r\ntreated with great respect by William the
        Conqueror, who allowed her an\r\napartment in the King\u2019s palace at Winchester,
        where she died, and was\r\ninterred here, by his express orders.\r\n\r\nNear
        the remains of this Princess lie those of Queen Maud, surnam\u2019d the\r\nGood,
        the daughter of Malcolm Conmair, King of Scotland, to whom she was\r\nespoused,
        in order to unite the Saxon and Norman lines, and thereby to\r\nreconcile
        the affections of the English to the future Kings that should\r\nspring from
        them. She died on the 11th of May 1118. This excellent\r\nPrincess was distinguished
        by her many virtues, particularly her\r\nhumility, and her placing her chief
        delight in relieving the poor.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of this chapel is
        the tomb of Henry III. the pannels\r\nare of polish\u2019d porphyry, and around
        them is mosaic work of gold and\r\nscarlet. At the corners of the table are
        twisted pillars, gilt, and\r\nenamell\u2019d, and upon it is placed the effigy
        of that King in brass gilt,\r\nfinely executed. He died in 1272, aged 65,
        after a troublesome reign of\r\n56 years.\r\n\r\nAt the feet of the last mentioned
        Prince lies the effigy of Eleanor,\r\nQueen to Edward I. On the sides of this
        monument are engraven the arms\r\nof Castile and Leon, quarterly, and those
        of Ponthieu, hanging on vines\r\nand oak-trees, and round the copper verge
        is embossed this inscription\r\nin Saxon characters;\r\n\r\n              _Icy
        gist Alianor Jadis Reyne de Angleterre,\r\n                       Femme al.
        Re. Edward Fiz._\r\n\r\n                                That is,\r\n\r\n               _Here
        lies Eleanor, once Queen of England,\r\n                         Wife to King
        Edward._\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, that the body of this Queen was only interred
        here,\r\nand that her heart was placed in the choir of the friars predicants
        in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nThere is also here a large plain coffin of grey marble,
        composed of\r\nseven stones, four of which form the sides, two the ends, and
        one the\r\ncover. This rough unpolished tomb incloses the body of the glorious
        King\r\nEdward I. just mentioned, who was born on the 17th of June 1239. He
        was\r\nnamed Edward, in honour of Edward the Confessor, and afterwards surnamed\r\nLong
        Shanks, from his tall and slender habit of body. This brave Prince\r\ndied
        on the 7th of July 1307, aged 68.\r\n\r\nIn this chapel is a tomb of black
        marble, to the memory of Philippa, the\r\nthird daughter to William Earl of
        Hainault, and Queen to King Edward\r\nIII. who bestowed a profusion of expence
        on her tomb, round which were\r\nplaced as ornaments, the brazen statues of
        no less than thirty Kings,\r\nPrinces, and noble personages her relations.\r\n\r\nTho\u2019
        Edward III. was interred in the same grave as the Queen, he has a\r\nmonument
        erected for him adjoining to hers, covered with a Gothic\r\ncanopy. The effigy
        of this Prince, who died June 21, 1377, lies on a\r\ntomb of grey marble,
        and at his head are placed the shield and sword\r\ncarried before him in France:
        the latter is seven feet long, and weighs\r\neighteen pounds. This tomb was,
        like the former, surrounded with\r\nstatues, particularly with those of his
        children.\r\n\r\nNext to this is the tomb of Richard II. and his Queen, over
        which is a\r\ncanopy of wood, remarkable for a painting of the Virgin Mary
        and our\r\nSaviour still visible. This Prince was murdered on Valentine\u2019s
        day 1399,\r\nand on the robing of his effigy are curiously wrought, peascod
        shells\r\nopen, and the peas out, perhaps in allusion to his being once in
        full\r\npossession of sovereignty, which before his murder, was reduced to
        an\r\nempty title.\r\n\r\nBetween St. Edward\u2019s shrine, and the tomb of
        Queen Philippa, under a\r\nlarge stone, once plated with brass, lies the great
        Thomas of Woodstock,\r\nDuke of Gloucester, and uncle to the above Richard
        II. who murdered him\r\non the 8th of September, 1397, for being too free
        and too faithful a\r\nmonitor.\r\n\r\nHere is also a table monument in memory
        of Margaret, daughter to Edward\r\nIV. by his Queen Elizabeth Woodville; and
        a small monument of black\r\nLydian marble finely polished, in memory of Elizabeth
        Tudor, the second\r\ndaughter of Henry VIII who died at three years of age.\r\n\r\n_Henry
        the Fifth\u2019s Chapel_, is only parted from St. Edward\u2019s by an iron\r\nscreen,
        on each side of which are statues as big as the life. His\r\nmonument, which
        is surrounded with iron rails and gates, is of black\r\nmarble, and upon it
        is placed his statue; but what is very remarkable,\r\nit lies without the
        head. Your guides say, that the body is heart of\r\noak, and the head of beaten
        silver; as were also the scepter and other\r\nensigns of royalty with which
        this statue was adorned; but that the\r\nvalue of these occasioned their being
        sacrilegiously taken away. This is\r\nby some writers represented at a ridiculous
        tale. Over this tomb is a\r\nchauntry chapel, in which the weapons, armour,
        and caparisons of Henry\r\nV. were carefully laid up, and remain to this day.\r\n\r\nNear
        this tomb lies enclosed in an old wooden chest, the remains of\r\nCatharine,
        daughter of Charles VI. King of France, and the consort of\r\nHenry V. She
        died on the 2d of January 1437, and was honourably interred\r\nin the chapel
        erected by Henry III. but when her grandson Henry VII.\r\npulled down that
        to build his own chapel, her body was taken up, when\r\nthe bones appeared
        firmly united, and thinly covered with flesh; but the\r\ncoffin being decayed,
        was put into a wooden chest, and removed to the\r\nplace where it is now seen.
        This is the account given by those who shew\r\nthis venerable dust, the miserable
        remains of a lady of royal blood, and\r\nof distinguished beauty.\r\n\r\n_The
        Chapel of St. Andrew_, which is next the northern cross, has in the\r\ncenter
        a magnificent monument erected to the memory of Sir Francis\r\nNorris, ancestor
        to the late Sir John Norris. In the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth he distinguished
        himself by his bravery in the Low Countries,\r\nand was created Lord Norris
        of Rycot. This monument has a fine\r\nrepresentation of an encampment in relief,
        and is otherwise beautifully\r\nornamented; but has no inscription.\r\n\r\nAgainst
        the east wall is a table monument to the memory of Sir John\r\nBurgh, who
        was killed in 1594, in taking a large Spanish ship, laden\r\nwith gold, silver
        and jewels of inestimable value.\r\n\r\nIn one corner is an ancient monument
        of Robert Kirton, that has several\r\nlabels in black letters round his portrait,
        which rests upon eagles\r\ncrowned. He died Oct. 3, 1466.\r\n\r\n_St. Michael\u2019s
        Chapel_ has only one monument worthy of notice, which is\r\n  that of Sarah,
        Duchess of Somerset; and mother to the last Duke of\r\n  that branch of the
        family. On the base sit two charity boys, one on\r\n  each side, lamenting
        the loss of their great benefactress, who is\r\n  represented resting upon
        her arm, under a canopy of state, and looking\r\n  earnestly upon a group
        of cherubims, issuing from the clouds above\r\n  her. Underneath is a Latin
        inscription, enumerating her many\r\n  charitable foundations, and informing
        us that this excellent Lady died\r\n  on the 5th of September 1692.\r\n\r\n_St.
        John the Evangelist\u2019s Chapel_, has in the center a curious monument\r\n
        \ to Sir Francis Vere, a gentleman of the first reputation for learning\r\n
        \ and bravery, who particularly distinguished himself at the battle of\r\n
        \ Newport, in which he commanded in front under Prince Maurice, in the\r\n
        \ service of the States, against the Spaniards. This great warrior was\r\n
        \ 30 years in the Dutch service, and in 20 of them commanded the\r\n  auxiliary
        troops of England. He died on the 28th of August 1608, in\r\n  the 54th year
        of his age. His monument is a table supported by four\r\n  knights kneeling,
        on which lie the several parts of a complete suit of\r\n  armour, and underneath
        the effigies of Sir Francis, lying, as if\r\n  undressed, in a loose gown,
        on a quilt of alabaster. On the base is a\r\n  short Latin inscription in
        gold letters, shewing to whom it belongs;\r\n  that he was nephew to the Earl
        of Oxford, and Governor of Portsmouth\r\n  and the Brille, and that his disconsolate
        widow consecrated this\r\n  monument to his memory.\r\n\r\n  Close to the
        wall is a monument of Sir George Hollis, nephew to Sir\r\n  Francis Vere,
        and a Major General under him. On the pedestal is\r\n  represented the siege
        of a town in relief, where the principal figure\r\n  is a General on horseback
        holding a battoon, and having one eye\r\n  blemished, perhaps alluding to
        the siege of Newport, in which Sir\r\n  George also gained great honour, and
        had a horse killed under him. On\r\n  each side of this pedestal sits a Pallas,
        lamenting the death of the\r\n  great warrior, who is represented above in
        the Roman habit, standing\r\n  erect upon a lofty altar, with a cherub supporting
        the plinth on which\r\n  he stands. Sir George died in January 1626. An ingenious
        author\r\n  speaking of this monument, says, that Sir George was the first
        erect\r\n  figure set up in the Abbey; \u201Can attitude, says he, which I
        am far from\r\n  discommending, for \u2019tis my opinion, statues should always
        represent\r\n  life and action: \u2019tis peculiarly adapted to heroes, who
        ought never to\r\n  be supposed at rest, and should have their characters
        represented as\r\n  strong as possible: this before us is bold and manly,
        though not\r\n  chaste and elegant: \u2019tis finely elevated too, and the
        mourning\r\n  Pallases, at the base of it, are both well fancied and well
        applied.\u201D\r\n\r\n  Near Sir Francis\u2019s tomb is that of Aubery de
        Vere, the last Earl of\r\n  Oxford of that name, and Lieutenant-General of
        Queen Anne\u2019s forces,\r\n  who died March 12, 1702.\r\n\r\n  In this chapel
        there are also some antique monuments; particularly on\r\n  the right hand,
        is that of John de Eastney, one of the Abbots, who was\r\n  a great benefactor
        to this church, and died on the 4th of May 1438. A\r\n  brazen statue of this
        Abbot in his mass habit, lies upon his tomb. It\r\n  is remarkable, that in
        breaking up a grave about thirty years ago, his\r\n  body was discovered in
        a coffin quilted with yellow sattin, having on\r\n  a gown of crimson silk,
        girded round him with a black girdle; on his\r\n  legs were white silk stockings,
        and over his face a clean napkin\r\n  doubled up, and laid corner wise. His
        body and legs are said to have\r\n  been plump and firm, but his face somewhat
        discoloured.\r\n\r\n  There is likewise here the monument of Sir John Harpedon,
        Knt. who\r\n  died in 1457. He lies in armour, resting his feet on a lion,
        and his\r\n  head on a greyhound.\r\n\r\n_St. Erasmus\u2019s, or Islip\u2019s
        Chapel_, has but two monuments worthy of\r\n  notice; the first that of John
        Islip, Abbot of Westminster, the\r\n  founder of this chapel, which he dedicated
        to St. Erasmus. It is\r\n  adorned with much carving in devices, intaglios,
        and febuses, alluding\r\n  to the name of the founder, as a person slipping
        boughs off a tree; an\r\n  eye with the slip of the tree; and a youth sliding
        from a bough, with\r\n  _I slip_, in a label proceeding out of his mouth.
        In the middle is\r\n  Islip\u2019s tomb which is a plain marble table, supported
        by four small\r\n  brass pillars; over it was anciently painted on the roof,
        a picture of\r\n  our Saviour on the cross. He died in January 1510.\r\n\r\n
        \ The other is the tomb of Sir Christopher Hatton, son to Christopher\r\n
        \ Hatton, Lord Chancellor of England. The principal figures are a knight\r\n
        \ in armour, and a lady in deep mourning resting on the ascending sides\r\n
        \ of a triangular pediment, parted in the middle by a trunkless helmet.\r\n
        \ Over their heads is a neat piece of architecture, in the center of\r\n  which
        is a scroll with their arms, held up by naked boys, one of whom\r\n  holds
        an extinguished torch reversed over the Knight, to shew that Sir\r\n  Christopher
        died first; the other over the Lady holds his torch\r\n  upright and burning,
        to signify that she survived him. The inscription\r\n  informs us, that Sir
        Christopher died on the 10th of September 1619.\r\n\r\n  Over this chapel
        is a chauntry, in which are two large wainscot\r\n  presses, filled with the
        effigies of Princes, and others of high\r\n  quality, interred in the Abbey.
        These effigies, \u2019tis said, resembled\r\n  the deceased as near as possible,
        and were formerly exposed at the\r\n  funerals of our Princes and other great
        personages, in open chariots,\r\n  with their proper ensigns of royalty or
        honour. Those here deposited\r\n  are all maimed, some stripped, and others
        in tattered robes; but the\r\n  most ancient are the least injured, which
        seems as if the value of\r\n  their cloaths had occasioned this ravage; for
        the robes of Edward VI.\r\n  that were once of crimson velvet, but now appear
        like leather, are\r\n  left entire; while those of Queen Elizabeth and King
        James I. are\r\n  taken away, as is every thing of value from all the rest.\r\n\r\n_St.
        John Baptist\u2019s Chapel_, contains several monuments: one at the\r\n  entrance
        is to the memory of Mrs. Mary Kendall, the daughter of Thomas\r\n  Kendall,
        Esq; she died in her thirty-third year, and her epitaph\r\n  informs us, that
        \u201Cher many virtues rendered her every way worthy of\r\n  that close union
        and friendship, in which she lived with Lady\r\n  Catharine Jones; and in
        testimony of which, she desired that even\r\n  their ashes, after death, might
        not be divided; and therefore ordered\r\n  herself here to be interred, where
        she knew that excellent Lady\r\n  designed one day to rest, near the grave
        of her beloved and religious\r\n  mother, Elizabeth Countess of Kendall.\u201D\r\n\r\n
        \ Next to this is a monument erected to the memory of Col. Edward\r\n  Popham,
        and his Lady, whose statues in white marble stand under a\r\n  lofty canopy,
        resting their arms in a thoughtful posture upon a marble\r\n  altar, on which
        lie the gloves of an armed knight. This gentleman was\r\n  an active officer
        in Cromwell\u2019s army, and his atchievements were here\r\n  inscribed on
        his tomb. Upon the restoration, the monument was ordered\r\n  to be demolished,
        and the inscription erased; but at the intercession\r\n  of some of his Lady\u2019s
        relations, who had eminently served his Majesty,\r\n  the stone whereon the
        inscription was cut was only turned inwards, and\r\n  no other injury done
        to his monument.\r\n\r\n  In the midst of this chapel is a large table monument
        for Thomas\r\n  Cecil, Earl of Exeter, Baron Burleigh, Knight of the Garter,
        and Privy\r\n  Counsellor to King James I. whereon is placed his statue lying
        down,\r\n  with his Lady on his right side, and a vacant space on his left
        for\r\n  another. The Lady on his right side is his first wife the Lady Dorothy\r\n
        \ Nevil, daughter to the Lord Latimer; and the vacant space was left for\r\n
        \ his second wife, Frances Bridges, of the noble family of Chandois; but\r\n
        \ as the right side was taken up, she gave express orders in her will,\r\n
        \ not to place her effigy on his left, however, according to the\r\n  inscription,
        they are all buried together in one vault.\r\n\r\n  But the most magnificent
        monument in this chapel is against the east\r\n  wall, where stood the altar
        of St. John Baptist; this was erected to\r\n  the memory of Henry Carey, first
        cousin to Queen Elizabeth, who, on\r\n  being denied the honours of peerage,
        laid the disappointment so much\r\n  to heart, that he languished for a long
        time on a sick bed, at which\r\n  the Queen being moved, too late, created
        him a Baron, and ordered the\r\n  patent and robes to be laid before him,
        but without effect. He died on\r\n  the 23d of July 1596, aged seventy-two.\r\n\r\n
        \ Here also is a monument to Thomas Carey, second son to the Earl of\r\n  Monmouth,
        who is said to have died of grief in 1648, at the age of\r\n  thirty-three,
        on account of the untimely fate of his royal master King\r\n  Charles I.\r\n\r\n
        \ Here are likewise a few antique monuments, particularly one in which\r\n
        \ the figure of a Bishop properly habited, lies under a Gothic canopy.\r\n
        \ This is supposed to be erected for Thomas Rathal, Bishop of Durham,\r\n
        \ who died in 1524.\r\n\r\n  And an ancient stone monument for William of
        Colchester, whose\r\n  effigies lie with the head supported by an angel, and
        the feet by a\r\n  lamb.\r\n\r\n_St. Paul\u2019s Chapel_, has on the left
        hand, a lofty monument erected to\r\n  the memory of Sir John Puckering, Knt.
        and Lord Chancellor in the\r\n  reign of Queen Elizabeth, in which office
        he died on the 20th of April\r\n  1596. His epitaph in Latin over his effigies,
        is thus translated:\r\n\r\n         The publick care and laws engag\u2019d
        my breast,\r\n           To live was toilsome, but to die is rest;\r\n         Wealth,
        maces, guards, crowns, titles, things that fade,\r\n           The prey of
        Time and sable Death are made.\r\n\r\n                           VIRTUE INSPIRES
        MEN.\r\n\r\n             His Wife this statue rears to her lov\u2019d spouse,\r\n
        \                The test of constancy and marriage vows.\r\n        _I trust
        I shall see the Lord in the Land of the Living._\r\n\r\n  Adjoining to this
        monument, is one, much decay\u2019d, for Sir James\r\n  Fullerton and his
        Lady, whose effigies lie upon it, and on a table of\r\n  black marble is the
        following quaint inscription:\r\n\r\n               Here lie the Remains of
        Sir James Fullerton,\r\n                  Knt. first Gentleman of the Bedchamber\r\n
        \                   to King Charles the First (Prince\r\n                   and
        King) a generous Rewarder of all\r\n                 Virtue, a severe Reprover
        of all Vice, a\r\n                   profest Renouncer of all Vanity. He\r\n
        \                 was a firm Pillar to the Commonwealth,\r\n                a
        faithful Patron to the Catholic Church,\r\n                 a fair Pattern
        to the British Court. He\r\n                 lived to the Welfare of his Country,
        to\r\n                  the Honour of his Prince, to the Glory\r\n                  of
        his God. He died _fuller_ of Faith\r\n                than of Fear, _fuller_
        of Resolution than\r\n                of Pain, _fuller_ of Honour than of
        Days.\r\n\r\n  There is a monument erected to the memory of Sir James Bromley,\r\n
        \ Chancellor to Queen Elizabeth, who died on the 12th of April 1587.\r\n  This
        monument is of alabaster, with pillars of Lydian marble gilt, and\r\n  Sir
        James is represented lying in his Chancellor\u2019s habit, with his\r\n  four
        sons and four daughters kneeling on the base.\r\n\r\n  In the same chapel
        is a plain monument of Sir Dudley Carlton, who for\r\n  his services to King
        James I. and King Charles I. was made Viscount\r\n  Dorchester, and Secretary
        of State. He died on the 15th of February\r\n  1631, and is represented on
        his tomb sitting in a half rais\u2019d posture.\r\n\r\n  To the east of this
        monument is another of alabaster to the memory of\r\n  Frances the wife of
        Thomas Ratcliffe, Earl of Sussex, who\r\n  distinguished herself by her humanity
        and generosity, and died on the\r\n  15th of April 1589. She is represented
        in a recumbent posture, resting\r\n  on an embroidered cushion, dressed in
        robes, and with a coronet on her\r\n  head.\r\n\r\n  Next to this is the monument
        of Francis Lord Cottington of Hanworth,\r\n  who died on the 9th of June 1652,
        and of his Lady who died in 1633.\r\n  This monument is of black touchstone,
        and remarkably different from\r\n  every other in the Abbey, On the top is
        a circular frame of gilt\r\n  brass, enclosing the bust of the Lady, and beneath
        is his Lordship on\r\n  a table monument resting on his left arm, and over
        a satyr\u2019s head is\r\n  the inscription in English mentioning his Lordship\u2019s
        titles and\r\n  employments.\r\n\r\n_St. Nicholas\u2019s Chapel_ contains
        several remarkable monuments: near the\r\n  entrance is one of black marble,
        finely polished, to the memory of the\r\n  Lady Jane Clifford, youngest daughter
        to the Duke of Somerset, and\r\n  wife to Charles Lord Clifford and Dungarvan,
        who died Nov. 23, 1679.\r\n  This black monument is adorned with cherubims
        and a scroll of\r\n  alabaster, whereon is written a long inscription in English,\r\n
        \ containing an account of the Lady\u2019s descent and marriage.\r\n\r\n  By
        the door on the same side, is a monument of alabaster erected for\r\n  Lady
        Cecil, the daughter of Lord Cobham, who having married Sir Robert\r\n  Cecil,
        son to William Lord Burleigh, Treasurer of England, died in\r\n  child-bed
        in 1591. The Latin inscription is a dialogue between herself\r\n  and husband,
        expressing their mutual affection.\r\n\r\n  At some distance is a magnificent
        temple of various coloured marble,\r\n  erected to the memory of Anne Duchess
        of Somerset, wife to Edward Duke\r\n  of Somerset. She died on the 16th of
        April 1618, aged twenty-eight.\r\n  The inscription is in Latin and English,
        and contains a pompous detail\r\n  of the noble lineage of this great Lady,
        her alliances and issue.\r\n\r\n  In this chapel is likewise a very expensive
        monument, erected by the\r\n  great Lord Burleigh, to the memory of his wife
        Mildred, and their\r\n  daughter the Lady Anne, Countess of Oxford, representing
        a stately\r\n  temple built with porphyry, and other kinds of marble gilt.
        It is\r\n  divided into two compartments, one elevated over the other. In
        the\r\n  lower lies Lady Burleigh, in a recumbent posture, with her daughter\r\n
        \ Lady Jane in her arms; and at her head and feet are her children and\r\n
        \ grand-children kneeling. In the upper compartment is the figure of a\r\n
        \ venerable old man, supposed to be the Lord Burleigh, on his knees, as\r\n
        \ if at fervent prayer. The Lady Burleigh died April 4, 1589, aged\r\n  sixty-three,
        after being forty years married, and her daughter, the\r\n  Lady Oxford, June
        5, 1588. On the tomb is a long Latin inscription,\r\n  explaining the figures,
        and displaying their respective virtues and\r\n  accomplishments.\r\n\r\n
        \ The next monument I shall mention in this chapel, is that of the Lady\r\n
        \ Winifrid, married first to Sir Richard Sackville, Knt. and afterwards\r\n
        \ to John Paulet, Marquis of Winchester. On the base are the figures of\r\n
        \ a Knight armed and kneeling, and facing him a Lady in mourning also on\r\n
        \ her knees; behind whose back lies an infant on a baptismal font with\r\n
        \ its head supported by a pillow.\r\n\r\n  In the middle of the chapel is
        a fine raised monument of polished\r\n  marble, to the memory of Sir George
        Villars and his Lady, whose son\r\n  was raised by King James I. to the dignity
        of Duke of Buckingham.\r\n\r\n  In this chapel are two beautiful pyramids;
        the largest erected to the\r\n  memory of Nicholas Bagnal, a child of two
        months old, overlaid by his\r\n  nurse; the other to the memory of Anna Sophia
        Harley, a child of a\r\n  year old, daughter to the Hon. Christopher Harley
        Embassador to the\r\n  French King. She died in the year 1600, and her father,
        as appears by\r\n  the inscription, caused her heart to be inclosed in a cup,
        and placed\r\n  upon the top of the pyramid.\r\n\r\n  There are also in this
        chapel, a monument to the memory of the Lady\r\n  Elizabeth Fanes, and one
        or two others, scarcely worth notice.\r\n\r\n  _The Chapel of St. Edmund_,
        has at the entrance a lofty monument with\r\n  Gothic spires erected to the
        memory of John of Eltham, second son to\r\n  King Edward III. and so called
        from Eltham in Kent. His statue in\r\n  armour is of white alabaster, the
        head incircled by a coronet. He died\r\n  in Scotland at nineteen years of
        age, unmarried, tho\u2019 three different\r\n  matches had been proposed to
        him, the last of which, to Mary daughter\r\n  of Ferdinand King of Spain,
        he accepted, but lived not to consummate\r\n  it.\r\n\r\n  Next to this is
        a small table monument, on which lie the effigies of\r\n  William of Windsor,
        and Blanch of the Tower, the son and daughter of\r\n  Edward III. They took
        their surnames from the places of their birth,\r\n  and both died in their
        infancy. They are dressed in the habits of the\r\n  times, the young Prince
        in a short doublet, of the indecency of which\r\n  Chaucer\u2019s parson complains,
        and the Princess in a horned head-dress,\r\n  which Stow says, was frightful.\r\n\r\n
        \ On another tomb lies the statue of the Lady Frances, Duchess of\r\n  Suffolk,
        represented dressed in her robes. She was the daughter of the\r\n  famous
        Charles Brandon by Mary the French Queen, daughter to Henry\r\n  VII. and
        became Duchess of Suffolk by marrying Henry Grey, Marquis of\r\n  Dorset,
        who, upon her father\u2019s decease, was created Duke of Suffolk.\r\n  On
        her tomb are two inscriptions, the first in Latin verse in praise\r\n  of
        her virtues, and the other in English, shewing her different\r\n  marriages.\r\n\r\n
        \ The next is an elegant monument of white marble, erected by John Earl\r\n
        \ of Clare, to the memory of his son Francis Hollis, a youth of great\r\n
        \ bravery, who, after returning from making a campaign in Flanders, died\r\n
        \ on the 12th of August 1622, aged eighteen. He is represented clad in\r\n
        \ Grecian armour, sitting on a Greek altar. A good author mentioning\r\n  this
        statue, says, that it expresses more juvenile sweetness and\r\n  beauty, than
        any thing of the kind he ever saw, and that if this\r\n  figure has any fault
        in character or design, it is being placed in a\r\n  languid sedentary posture,
        tho\u2019 cloathed in armour, and described as a\r\n  hero in his bloom; a
        more spirited attitude, he observes, would have\r\n  been more suitable to
        the person represented, would have given the\r\n  statuary greater latitude
        to exert his genius, and afforded more\r\n  satisfaction to the spectator.
        The epitaph on this is as follows:\r\n\r\n            What so thou hast of
        nature or of arts,\r\n            Youth, beauty, strength, or what excelling
        parts\r\n            Of mind and body, letters, arms, and worth,\r\n            His
        eighteen years, beyond his years brought forth;\r\n            Then stand,
        and read thyself within this glass,\r\n            How soon these perish,
        and thy self may pass;\r\n            Man\u2019s life is measur\u2019d by
        the work, not days,\r\n            No aged sloth, but active youth hath praise.\r\n\r\n
        \ On an altar, in the same taste, but differently ornamented, sits the\r\n
        \ statue of the Lady Elizabeth Russel, the daughter of Lord Russel. This\r\n
        \ statue is of white alabaster, and the Lady is represented in a\r\n  sleeping
        posture. Your guides say, that she died with a prick of her\r\n  finger; but
        this story has no other foundation, than a misapprehension\r\n  of the statuary\u2019s
        design; for having represented her asleep, and\r\n  pointing with her finger
        to a death\u2019s head under her right foot, it\r\n  has been supposed, by
        the position of her finger pointing downwards,\r\n  that it was bleeding,
        and that this had closed her eyes in death;\r\n  though the artist\u2019s
        design seems rather to allude to the composed\r\n  situation of her mind at
        the approach of death, which she considered\r\n  only as a profound sleep,
        from which she was again to wake to a joyful\r\n  resurrection, of which the
        motto under her feet, is an evident\r\n  illustration; _Dormit, non mortua
        est_; \u201CShe is not dead, but\r\n  sleepeth.\u201D The Latin inscription
        on the scroll beneath, only tells\r\n  that this monument was erected to her
        memory by her afflicted sister\r\n  Anne. The device is an eagle, the emblem
        of eternity, resting on a\r\n  florilege of roses, &c.\r\n\r\n  Within the
        iron rails that inclose this last monument, is a\r\n  magnificent one to the
        memory of John Lord Russel, son and heir to\r\n  Francis Earl of Bedford,
        and of his young son Francis, by Elizabeth\r\n  the daughter of Sir Anthony
        Cook, Knt. This monument is of various\r\n  coloured marble and alabaster,
        and is adorned with gilding. Lord\r\n  Russel is represented lying in his
        robes, with his infant son at his\r\n  feet. His Lady, who erected this tomb,
        was esteemed the Sappho of the\r\n  age, and was not only an excellent poetess,
        but mistress of the\r\n  learned languages; and five epitaphs on this tomb
        are of her\r\n  composition, three of which are in Latin, one in Greek, and
        the other\r\n  in English, which last is here transcribed as a specimen of
        the rest,\r\n  that are to the same purpose:\r\n\r\n             Right noble
        twice, by virtue, and by birth,\r\n             Of Heaven lov\u2019d, and
        honour\u2019d on the earth:\r\n             His country\u2019s hope, his kindred\u2019s
        chief delight,\r\n             My husband dear, more the world\u2019s fair
        light,\r\n             Death hath me \u2019reft. But I from death will take\r\n
        \            His memory, to whom this tomb I make.\r\n             John was
        his name (ah, was!) wretch, must I say;\r\n             Lord Russel once,
        now my tear-thirsty clay.\r\n\r\n  In this chapel is a monument partly enclosed,
        to the memory of Talbot\r\n  Earl of Shrewsbury and his Lady, who are represented
        lying on a black\r\n  marble table supported by an alabaster pedestal. This
        monument is\r\n  adorned with variegated marble finely carved. The inscription
        contains\r\n  his titles and character, which is a very noble one, and informs
        us\r\n  that he died on the 8th of February 1617, in the fifty-seventh year
        of\r\n  his age.\r\n\r\n  In this chapel are several other monuments, adorned
        in their ancient\r\n  manner, with statues lying flat on the backs; and also
        some other\r\n  monuments affixed to the walls.\r\n\r\n  _The Chapel of St.
        Benedict_, which is that next to the south cross,\r\n  has a monument erected
        to the memory of Lionel Cranfield Earl of\r\n  Middlesex, Lord High Treasurer
        of England in the reign of King James\r\n  I. This monument was erected by
        his relict the Lady Anne, and is of\r\n  black marble, on which are two statues
        in a recumbent posture,\r\n  representing his Lordship lying in his robes,
        with his Lady. It has a\r\n  long Latin inscription, representing his various
        employments and\r\n  honours, and that he finished his life in a retired leisure,
        and died\r\n  on the 6th of August 1645, aged seventy.\r\n\r\n  On the east
        side, where stood the altar of St. Benedict, is a monument\r\n  of various
        kinds of marble, in memory of Lady Frances Countess of\r\n  Hertford, who
        died on the 14th of May 1598, in the forty-fourth year\r\n  of her age. It
        is of various kinds of marble, and the Countess is in\r\n  the old taste represented
        in her robes, lying with her head resting on\r\n  an embroidered cushion,
        and her feet on the back of a lion.\r\n\r\n  On the south side of this chapel
        is a table monument of white marble\r\n  to the memory of George Sprat, the
        second son of Dr. Sprat, Bishop of\r\n  Rochester, an infant of a year old.\r\n\r\n
        \ Near it is the monument of Dr. Gabriel Goodman, the first Dean of this\r\n
        \ church, who founded an hospital, and instituted a school at Rathven in\r\n
        \ Denbighshire, where he was born. He was a person of great piety, and\r\n
        \ was the first who raised the learned Camden from obscurity. He is\r\n  represented
        kneeling, in his proper habit. He died in 1601.\r\n\r\n  _The Tombs in the
        open parts of the Abbey._\r\n\r\n  1. At the corner of the last mentioned
        chapel is a plain neat monument\r\n  to the memory of Mr. Dryden, adorned
        with no other ornaments than an\r\n  elegant bust of that great poet. It was
        erected by the late Duke of\r\n  Buckingham, who thought no inscription necessary
        to transmit the fame\r\n  of that great poet to posterity; we therefore only
        see these few\r\n  words, J. DRYDEN, born 1632, died May 1, 1700, and underneath,
        John\r\n  Sheffield Duke of Buckinghamshire erected this monument, 1720.\r\n\r\n
        \ 2. High on a pillar is a neat table monument to the memory of Mrs.\r\n  Martha
        Birch, who died in 1723, in the fiftieth year of her age. The\r\n  inscription
        also informs us, that she was daughter to Francis Viner,\r\n  Esq; and was
        first married to Francis Millington, Esq; and after his\r\n  death to Peter
        Birch, Prebendary of this Abbey; and that she was\r\n  pious, chaste, and
        prudent.\r\n\r\n  3. At a small distance is a plain neat monument, to the
        memory of\r\n  Abraham Cowley, on which is placed a flaming urn, begirt with
        a\r\n  chaplet of laurel; expressive emblems of the glory he acquired by the\r\n
        \ spirit of his writings. The Latin inscription and epitaph on the\r\n  pedestal
        have been thus translated.\r\n\r\n  Near this place lies ABRAHAM COWLEY, the
        Pindar, Horace, and Virgil of\r\n  England; and the delight, ornament, and
        admiration of this age.\r\n\r\n            While, sacred bard, far worlds
        thy works proclaim,\r\n            And you survive in an immortal fame,\r\n
        \           Here may you bless\u2019d in pleasing quiet lie,\r\n            To
        guard thy urn may hoary Faith stand by;\r\n            And all thy favourite
        tuneful Nine repair\r\n            To watch thy dust with a perpetual care.\r\n
        \           Sacred for ever may this place be made,\r\n            And may
        no desperate hand presume t\u2019 invade\r\n            With touch unhallow\u2019d,
        this religious room,\r\n            Or dare affront thy venerable tomb;\r\n
        \           Unmov\u2019d and undisturb\u2019d till time shall end.\r\n            May
        Cowley\u2019s dust this marble shrine defend.\r\n\r\n      So wishes, and
        desires that wish may be sacred to posterity,\r\n      George Duke of Buckingham,
        who erected this monument for that\r\n      incomparable man. He died in the
        forty-ninth year of his age,\r\n      and was carried from Buckingham-house,
        with honourable pomp,\r\n      his exequies being attended by persons of illustrious\r\n
        \     characters of all degrees, and interred August 13, 1667.\r\n\r\n  His
        grave is just before the monument, as appears by a blue stone, on\r\n  which
        is engraved his name.\r\n\r\n  4. The monument of that ancient poet Geoffery
        Chaucer, was once a\r\n  handsome one in the Gothic stile; but is now defaced
        by time. Chaucer,\r\n  who is stiled the Father of the English poets, was
        the son of Sir John\r\n  Chaucer, a citizen of London, employed by Edward
        III. in negociations\r\n  abroad relating to trade. He was first a student
        at Cambridge; but\r\n  afterwards studied at Merton College, Oxford; and to
        perfect himself\r\n  in the knowledge of the laws, entered himself of the
        Middle Temple:\r\n  thus accomplished, he soon became a favourite at court,
        and was\r\n  employed as shield-bearer to the King; was a gentleman of the\r\n
        \ bedchamber, and by Edward III. was sent Embassador abroad. However, in\r\n
        \ the succeeding reign he fell into disgrace, and was committed to the\r\n
        \ Tower for high-treason, where he wrote his Testament of Love: but upon\r\n
        \ the death of Richard II. he became a greater favourite at court than\r\n
        \ ever, from his having married the great John of Gaunt\u2019s wife\u2019s
        sister.\r\n  He was born in 1328, and died in 1400.\r\n\r\n  5. The plain
        monument of Mr. John Phillips, has his bust in relief,\r\n  represented as
        in an arbour, interwoven with vines, laurel branches,\r\n  and apple-trees;
        and over it this motto, _Honos erit huic quoque\r\n  pomo_, alluding to the
        high qualities ascribed to the apple, in his\r\n  excellent poem called _Cyder_.
        He was author of but few pieces; but\r\n  those were masterly performances.
        His Blenheim, Splendid Shilling, and\r\n  Lyric Ode to Lord Bolingbroke on
        Tobacco, have been much admired. He\r\n  was the son of Dr. Stephen Phillips,
        Archdeacon of Salop, was born at\r\n  Brampton in Oxfordshire on the 30th
        of December 1676, and died of a\r\n  consumption at Hereford, on the 15th
        of February, 1708, in the prime\r\n  of his life. The inscription on his monument
        contains an account of\r\n  his virtues and abilities, and is the strongest
        testimony of his\r\n  merit, since that alone could inspire his great patron
        Sir Simon\r\n  Harcourt, Knt. with such a generous friendship for him, as
        to\r\n  countenance and encourage him in the amplest manner when living; and\r\n
        \ to extend his regard for him even after his death, by erecting this\r\n
        \ monument to his memory.\r\n\r\n  6. Next this is Mr. Michael Drayton\u2019s
        monument. This gentleman was\r\n  esteemed an excellent poet, and learned
        antiquarian. The inscription\r\n  and epitaph were formerly in gold letters;
        but are now almost\r\n  obliterated, and are as follow:\r\n\r\n              MICHAEL
        DRAYTON, Esq; a memorable Poet of his\r\n             Age, exchanged his Laurel
        for a Crown of Glory,\r\n                                Anno 1631.\r\n\r\n
        \               Do, pious marble! let thy Readers know\r\n                  What
        they, and what their Children owe\r\n                  To Drayton\u2019s Name,
        whose sacred dust\r\n                  We recommend unto thy trust;\r\n                Protect
        his mem\u2019ry and preserve his story;\r\n                Remain a lasting
        Monument of his Glory;\r\n                  And when thy Ruins shall disclaim\r\n
        \                 To be the Treasurer of his Name:\r\n                  His
        Name, that cannot fade, shall be\r\n                An everlasting Monument
        to thee.\r\n\r\n  7. Ben Johnson\u2019s monument is of white marble, and his
        bust is executed\r\n  with great happiness and spirit; \u2019tis inclosed
        with a tablature\r\n  ornamented with a few proper and elegant decorations,
        consisting of\r\n  emblematical figures: and has no other inscription but
        the words O\r\n  RARE BEN JOHNSON! This gentleman was the son of a clergyman,
        and\r\n  educated at Westminster school, while Mr. Camden was Master; but
        after\r\n  his father\u2019s death, his mother marrying a bricklayer, he was
        forced\r\n  from school, and being obliged to work for his father, \u2019tis
        said, that\r\n  at the building of Lincoln\u2019s Inn, he was sometimes seen
        at work with\r\n  his trowel in one hand, and Horace in the other. However,
        Mr. Camden\r\n  having an esteem for him on account of his abilities, recommended
        him\r\n  to Sir Walter Raleigh. He attended that brave man\u2019s son in his\r\n
        \ travels, and upon his return, entered himself at Cambridge; afterwards\r\n
        \ he wrote a considerable number of plays; became Poet Laureat to King\r\n
        \ James I. and died on the 16th of August 1637, aged 63. His tomb was\r\n
        \ erected by the Earl of Essex, who has inscribed his own name on the\r\n
        \ stone.\r\n\r\n  8. Spenser\u2019s tomb is of grey marble, and has suffered
        greatly by time.\r\n  It was erected in an age when taste was in its infancy
        in England, and\r\n  yet has something in it venerably plain, and not absurdly
        ornamental.\r\n  The inscription upon it is as follows:\r\n\r\n      Here
        lies (expecting the second coming of our Saviour Christ\r\n      Jesus) the
        Body of Edmund Spenser, the Prince of Poets in his\r\n      time, whose divine
        Spirit needs no other witness than the\r\n      works he left behind him.
        He was born in London in 1510, and\r\n      died 1596.\r\n\r\n  9. Above Spenser\u2019s
        monument is that of Samuel Butler, the author of\r\n  Hudibrass. By the Latin
        inscription, it appears, that it was erected\r\n  by John Barber, Esq; Citizen
        of London, and afterwards Lord Mayor in\r\n  1731, that he who was destitute
        of all things when alive, might not\r\n  want a monument when dead. Mr. Butler
        was born at Shernsham in\r\n  Worcestershire in 1612, and died at London in
        1680.\r\n\r\n  10. A plain and neat monument of white marble in memory of
        that divine\r\n  poet, John Milton, who died in 1674. Under a very elegant
        bust made by\r\n  Rysbrack is this inscription:\r\n\r\n      In the year of
        our Lord Christ 1737, this bust of the author\r\n      of _Paradise Lost_
        was placed here by William Benson, Esq; one\r\n      of the two auditors of
        the imprest to his Majesty, &c.\r\n\r\n  11. A monument erected to the memory
        of Thomas Shadwell, is adorned\r\n  with his bust crowned with a chaplet of
        bays, an urn, and other\r\n  decorations. It was erected to his honour by
        his son Dr. Thomas\r\n  Shadwell, and the Latin inscription informs us, that
        he was descended\r\n  from an ancient family in Staffordshire; was Poet Laureat
        and\r\n  Historiographer in the reign of King William, and died November 20,\r\n
        \ 1692, in the fifty-fifth year of his age. This poet was the author of\r\n
        \ several plays; but falling under the lash of Mr. Dryden, was satirized\r\n
        \ by him under the character of Ogg, in the second part of his Absalom\r\n
        \ and Achitophel.\r\n\r\n  12. The monument of Matthew Prior, is adorned with
        great expence. On\r\n  one side of the pedestal stands the figure of Thalia,
        one of the\r\n  Muses, with a flute in her hand; and on the other History,
        with her\r\n  book shut; between these statues is Prior\u2019s bust upon a
        raised altar,\r\n  and over it is a handsome pediment, on the ascending sides
        of which\r\n  are two boys, one with an hour-glass in his hand run out; the
        other\r\n  holding a torch reversed. On the apex of the pediment is an urn,
        and\r\n  on the base of the monument is a long inscription in Latin, mentioning\r\n
        \ the public posts and employments with which he had been intrusted; and\r\n
        \ above we are informed, that while he was writing the history of his\r\n
        \ own times, death interposed, and broke both the thread of his\r\n  discourse
        and of his life, on the 18th of September 1721, in the\r\n  fifty-seventh
        year of his age.\r\n\r\n  13. The monument of St. Evremond is a very plain
        one, adorned with a\r\n  bust. The inscription observes, that he was of a
        noble family in\r\n  Normandy, and was employed in the army of France, in
        which he rose to\r\n  the rank of a Marshal; but returning to Holland, was
        from thence\r\n  invited by King Charles II. into England, where he lived
        in the\r\n  greatest intimacy with the King and principal nobility; more\r\n
        \ particularly with the Duchess of Mazarine. He was of a very sprightly\r\n
        \ turn of humour, as well in his conversation as writings, and lived to\r\n
        \ the age of ninety, when he was carried off by a fit of the strangury,\r\n
        \ on the 9th of September 1703.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _S. Wale delin._
        _C. Grignion sc._ _Monument of\r\n  Shakespear_]\r\n\r\n\r\n  14. The monument
        erected to the memory of the immortal Shakespear, a\r\n  print of which we
        have here given, is worthy of that great dramatic\r\n  writer, and both the
        design and execution are extremely elegant. Upon\r\n  a handsome pedestal
        stands his statue in white marble in the habit of\r\n  the time in which he
        lived, with one elbow leaning upon some books,\r\n  and his head reclined
        upon his hand, in a posture of meditation. The\r\n  attitude, the dress, the
        shape, the genteel air, and fine composure\r\n  observable in this figure
        of Shakespear, cannot be sufficiently\r\n  admired, and the beautiful lines
        of his upon the scroll are happily\r\n  chosen.\r\n\r\n               The
        cloud-cap\u2019d towers, the gorgeous palaces,\r\n               The solemn
        temples, the great globe itself;\r\n               Yea, all which it inherits,
        shall dissolve,\r\n               And like the baseless fabric of a vision,\r\n
        \              Leave not a wreck behind.\r\n\r\n  Immediately over his head
        upon a curious piece of dark-coloured\r\n  marble, is the following inscription,
        in capital letters raised in\r\n  gold:\r\n\r\n                           GULIELMO
        SHAKESPEAR\r\n                         ANNO POST MORTEM CXXIV.\r\n                          AMOR
        PUBLICUS POSUIT.\r\n\r\n  The heads on the pedestal representing Henry V.
        Richard III. and Queen\r\n  Elizabeth, three principal characters in his plays,
        are likewise\r\n  proper ornaments to grace his tomb. In short, the taste
        that is here\r\n  shewn, does honour to those great names under whose direction,
        by the\r\n  public favour, it was so elegantly constructed; these were the
        Earl of\r\n  Burlington, Dr. Mead, Mr. Pope, and Mr. Martin. It was designed
        by\r\n  Kent, and executed by Scheemakers; and the expence defrayed by the\r\n
        \ grateful contributions of the public.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Fleetwood, then Master
        of Drury Lane Theatre, and Mr. Rich of\r\n  Covent Garden, gave each a benefit,
        arising from one of his own plays,\r\n  towards it, and the Dean and Chapter
        made a present of the ground.\r\n\r\n  15. The next monument is a very fine
        one to the memory of Nicholas\r\n  Rowe, Esq; and his only daughter. On a
        pedestal about twenty inches\r\n  high, which stands on an altar, is a fine
        bust of Mr. Rowe; near it is\r\n  his Lady in the deepest affliction, and
        between both, on a pyramid\r\n  behind, is a medalion, with the head of a
        young Lady in relief. On the\r\n  front of the pedestal is this inscription:\r\n\r\n
        \     To the memory of Nicholas Rowe, Esq; who died in 1718, aged\r\n      forty-five,
        and of Charlotte his only daughter, wife of Henry\r\n      Fane, Esq; who
        inheriting her father\u2019s spirit, and amiable in\r\n      her own innocence
        and beauty, died in the 23d year of her age,\r\n      1739.\r\n\r\n  Underneath
        upon the front of the altar are these lines:\r\n\r\n             Thy reliques,
        Rowe! to this sad shrine we trust,\r\n             And near thy Shakespear
        place thy honoured bust.\r\n             Oh! skill\u2019d, next him, to draw
        the tender tear,\r\n             For never heart felt passion more sincere:\r\n\r\n
        \            To nobler sentiments to fire the brave,\r\n             For never

        \            And blest, that timely from our scene remov\u2019d,\r\n             Thy
        soul enjoys that liberty it lov\u2019d.\r\n\r\n             To these so mourn\u2019d
        in death, so lov\u2019d in life,\r\n             The childless Mother, and
        the widow\u2019d Wife,\r\n             With tears inscribes this monumental
        stone,\r\n             That holds their ashes, and expects her own.\r\n\r\n
        \ 16. Near this last, is a fine monument erected to the memory of Mr.\r\n
        \ John Gay, by the Duke and Duchess of Queensberry, his great patrons.\r\n
        \ His bust is a very good one, and the masks, instruments of music, and\r\n
        \ other devices, are blended together in a group, in allusion to the\r\n  various
        species of writings in which he excelled, as farce, satire,\r\n  fable, and
        pastoral. The short epitaph in the front, was written by\r\n  himself, and
        has given some offence, as the sentiment at first view\r\n  seems by no means
        proper for a monument;\r\n\r\n                  Life is a jest, and all things
        shew it:\r\n                  I thought so once, but now I know it.\r\n\r\n
        \ Underneath are these lines:\r\n\r\n               Of manners gentle, of
        affections mild;\r\n               In wit, a man; simplicity, a child;\r\n
        \              With native humour temp\u2019ring virtuous rage,\r\n               Form\u2019d
        to delight, at once, and lash the age:\r\n               Above temptation
        in a low estate,\r\n               And uncorrupted, ev\u2019n among the great.\r\n
        \              A safe companion, and an easy friend;\r\n               Unblam\u2019d
        thro\u2019 life, lamented in thy end.\r\n               These are thy honours;
        not that here thy bust\r\n               Is mix\u2019d with Heroes, or with
        Kings thy dust;\r\n               But that the Worthy and the Good shall say,\r\n
        \              Striking their pensive bosoms\u2014Here lies Gay.\r\n                                                    A.
        POPE.\r\n\r\n  Here lie the ashes of Mr. John Gay, the warmest friend, the
        gentlest\r\n  companion, the most benevolent man; who maintained independency
        in low\r\n  circumstances of fortune; integrity, in the midst of a corrupt
        age;\r\n  and that equal serenity of mind, which conscious goodness alone
        can\r\n  give, throughout the whole course of his life. Favourite of the Muses,\r\n
        \ he was led by them to every elegant art, refined in taste, and fraught\r\n
        \ with graces all his own. In various kinds of poetry, superior to many,\r\n
        \ inferior to none: his works continue to inspire what his example\r\n  taught;
        contempt of folly, however adorned; detestation of vice,\r\n  however dignified;
        reverence of virtue, however disgraced.\r\n\r\n      Charles and Catharine,
        Duke and Duchess of Queensberry, who\r\n      loved his person living, and
        regret him dead, have caused this\r\n      monument to be erected to his memory.\r\n\r\n
        \ 17. The next is a most magnificent, lofty and elegant monument,\r\n  erected
        to the late Duke of Argyle, enclosed with rails, and decorated\r\n  with figures
        finely executed. The statue of the Duke is spirited even\r\n  at the verge
        of life. On one side of the base is Pallas, and on the\r\n  other Eloquence;
        the one looking sorrowfully up at the principal\r\n  figure above, and the
        other pathetically displaying the public loss at\r\n  his death. Above is
        the figure of History, with one hand holding a\r\n  book, and with the other
        writing on a pyramid of most beautiful\r\n  variegated marble, admirably polished,
        the name and titles of the Hero\r\n  in large gold letters, JOHN DUKE OF ARGYLE
        AND GR. at which point the\r\n  pen of History rests. His actions are supposed
        to be contained in the\r\n  book she holds in her other hand, on the cover
        of which in letters of\r\n  gold are inscribed the date of his Grace\u2019s
        death, and the years of his\r\n  life. Above is inscribed on this beautiful
        pyramid in gold letters,\r\n  the following epitaph, said to be written by
        Paul Whitehead, Esq;\r\n\r\n             Britain, behold, if patriot worth
        be dear,\r\n             A shrine that claims thy tributary tear:\r\n             Silent
        that tongue admiring Senates heard:\r\n             Nerveless that arm opposing
        legions fear\u2019d:\r\n             Nor less, O Campbell! thine the pow\u2019r
        to please,\r\n             And give to grandeur all the grace of ease.\r\n
        \            Long from thy life let kindred heroes trace\r\n             Arts
        which ennoble still the noblest race.\r\n             Others may owe their
        future fame to me,\r\n             I borrow immortality from thee.\r\n\r\n
        \ On the base of the monument is this inscription:\r\n\r\n      In memory
        of an honest man, a constant friend, JOHN the Great\r\n      Duke of Argyle
        and Greenwich, a General and Orator exceeded by\r\n      none in the age he
        lived. Sir Henry Fermer, Baronet, by his\r\n      last will left the sum of
        five hundred pounds towards erecting\r\n      this monument, and recommended
        the above inscription.\r\n\r\n  19. The monument of Isaac Barrow, D.D. is
        remarkable for a fine bust\r\n  of that great divine and mathematician, who,
        as the inscription shews,\r\n  was Chaplain to King Charles II. Head of Trinity
        College, Cambridge;\r\n  Professor of Geometry at Gresham College in London,
        and of Greek and\r\n  Mathematics at Cambridge. He died on the 14th of May
        1677, aged\r\n  forty-seven.\r\n\r\n  19. A table monument of white marble,
        erected to the memory of Sir\r\n  Richard Cox, who was taster to Queen Elizabeth,
        and King James I. and\r\n  to the latter steward of the household.\r\n\r\n
        \ 20. A neat monument erected to the memory of the learned Isaac\r\n  Casaubon,
        by Dr. Moreton, Bishop of Durham. That profound scholar and\r\n  critic whose
        name is inscribed upon it, was born in France, and in his\r\n  younger years
        was keeper of the royal library at Paris; but at length\r\n  being dissatisfied
        with the Romish religion, he, upon the murder of\r\n  his great patron Henry
        IV. quitted his native country, and at the\r\n  earnest entreaty of King James
        I. settled in England, where he died in\r\n  1614, aged forty-five.\r\n\r\n
        \ 21. Above this last monument, is another for John Earnest Grape, a\r\n  person
        well skilled in oriental learning, who is represented as large\r\n  as the
        life, sitting in a thoughtful posture upon a marble tomb, as if\r\n  contemplating
        on death.\r\n\r\n  22. Next to the west corner of the south cross is an ancient
        monument\r\n  to the memory of that great antiquarian William Camden, who
        is\r\n  represented in a half length, in the dress of his time, holding a
        book\r\n  in his right hand, and in his left his gloves. He rests on an altar,\r\n
        \ on the body of which is a Latin inscription, which mentions his\r\n  indefatigable
        industry in illustrating the British antiquities, and\r\n  his candour, sincerity,
        and pleasant good humour in private life. He\r\n  died Nov. 9, 1623.\r\n\r\n
        \ In this south cross are several stones to be met with on the pavement,\r\n
        \ worthy of notice. Among these is one over the body of Thomas Parr, of\r\n
        \ the county of Salop, born in 1483. He lived in the reigns of ten\r\n  Princes,
        King Edward IV. King Edward V. King Richard III. King Henry\r\n  VII. King
        Henry VIII. King Edward VI. Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth,\r\n  King James I.
        and King Charles I. and was interred here Nov. 15, 1635,\r\n  aged an hundred
        and fifty-two.\r\n\r\n  At a small distance from Parr, is a small white stone,
        over the body\r\n  of Sir William Davenant, who succeeded Ben Johnson as Poet
        Laureat to\r\n  King Charles I. and died in 1688, aged sixty-three. On this
        stone is\r\n  inscribed O RARE SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT! and this probably gave
        the\r\n  thought of putting the like inscription on the monument afterwards\r\n
        \ erected to his predecessor Ben Johnson.\r\n\r\n  Under the pavement near
        Dryden\u2019s tomb, lie the remains of Francis\r\n  Beaumont, the dramatic
        writer, who died in London in March, 1615, and\r\n  was buried here without
        either tomb or inscription.\r\n\r\n  Affixed to the pillars in this south
        cross, are also two table\r\n  monuments; which we shall but just mention,
        one for Samuel Barton,\r\n  D.D. a Prebendary of this church, who died in
        Sept. 1715, aged\r\n  sixty-two: and the other to the memory of Anthony Horneck,
        D.D. who\r\n  was born at Wittenberg in Zealand, but was educated at Oxford,
        and\r\n  became King\u2019s Divinity Professor and Chaplain, a Prebendary
        of this\r\n  church, and a Preacher at the Savoy. This gentleman, who was\r\n
        \ remarkable for his piety, died of the stone on the 30th of January,\r\n
        \ 1696, aged fifty-six.\r\n\r\n  23. On entering the south side, there is
        next the wall a monument\r\n  erected to the memory of Sophia Fairholm, Countess
        of Anandale. It is\r\n  the representation of an ancient sepulchre, over which
        a stately\r\n  edifice is raised, ornamented at the top with the family arms.
        She\r\n  died in the year 1716, aged forty-six; and the monumental inscription\r\n
        \ informs us, that it was erected by her son the Marquis of Anandale, as\r\n
        \ a mark of his duty and gratitude.\r\n\r\n  24. The monument of the brave
        Sir Cloudesly Shovel, who here appears a\r\n  very unmeaning figure, with
        a large stiff wig, reposing himself upon\r\n  velvet cushions under a canopy
        of state; and on the base is\r\n  represented in bas relief, the ship Association
        in which the Admiral\r\n  last sailed, striking against a rock, with several
        others perishing at\r\n  the same time, and at the top are two boys blowing
        trumpets.\r\n\r\n  This monument has been highly censured by all persons of
        taste, tho\u2019\r\n  it is erected to his memory at great expence, and even
        by his\r\n  Sovereign Queen Anne. The great Mr. Addison has justly exposed
        it in\r\n  the Spectators, and complains at this brave rough English Admiral\u2019s\r\n
        \ being here represented by the figure of a beau; and also censures the\r\n
        \ inscription, which instead of celebrating the many remarkable actions\r\n
        \ he had performed in the service of his country, only informs us of the\r\n
        \ manner of his death, from which it was impossible to reap any honour,\r\n
        \ tho\u2019 it may excite our pity. The inscription is as follows:\r\n\r\n
        \     Sir Cloudesly Shovel, Knt. Rear-Admiral of Great Britain, and\r\n      Admiral
        and Commander in chief of the fleet\u2014the just reward of\r\n      his long
        and faithful services. He was deservedly beloved of\r\n      his country,
        and esteemed, tho\u2019 dreaded by the enemy, who had\r\n      often experienced
        his conduct and courage. Being ship-wrecked\r\n      on the rocks of Scylly,
        in his voyage from Toulon, the 22d of\r\n      October 1707, at night, in
        the 57th year of his age. His fate\r\n      was lamented by all, but especially
        by the seafaring part of\r\n      the nation; to whom he was a generous patron,
        and a worthy\r\n      example. His body was flung on the shore, and buried
        with\r\n      others in the sand; but being soon after taken up, was placed\r\n
        \     under this monument, which his royal Mistress had caused to be\r\n      erected
        to commemorate his steady loyalty and extraordinary\r\n      virtues.\r\n\r\n
        \ 25. The monument of George Stepney, Esq; has his bust under a canopy,\r\n
        \ and two naked boys weeping and holding handkerchiefs at their eyes.\r\n
        \ This monument, though the materials are very rich, is allowed to be\r\n
        \ void of design, and but poorly executed. The Latin inscriptions give\r\n
        \ an account of his virtues, his learning and abilities, and the many\r\n
        \ negociations in which he was employed at foreign courts. He died at\r\n
        \ Chelsea in 1706.\r\n\r\n  26. A lofty and much more elegant monument for
        George Churchill, whose\r\n  merits are mentioned in a long Latin inscription,
        where it is said\r\n  that he was the second son of Sir Winston Churchill,
        of Dorsetshire,\r\n  Knt. and a not unworthy brother of John Duke of Marlborough:
        that he\r\n  was early trained to military affairs, and served with great
        honour by\r\n  sea and land, under King Charles II. King James II. King William
        III.\r\n  and Queen Anne: that he was Admiral of the English fleet, at the\r\n
        \ burning of the French fleet at La Hogue, in King William\u2019s reign; and\r\n
        \ for his bravery there, made one of the Commissioners of the Admiralty:\r\n
        \ that in the succeeding reign he was made Admiral in chief, and died on\r\n
        \ the 8th of May 1718, aged fifty-eight.\r\n\r\n  27. Near that of Churchill\u2019s,
        is a stately monument erected for Sir\r\n  Palmes Fairborne. Two pyramids
        of black marble standing on cannon\r\n  balls, have two Moorish Emperors heads
        in profile on their tops; these\r\n  pyramids are adorned with relievos, on
        one Sir Palmes is shot while\r\n  viewing the enemy\u2019s lines before the
        town; and on the other is a\r\n  hearse and six horses bringing him off wounded
        to the castle. Above in\r\n  a lofty dome are the arms of the deceased, with
        this motto underneath,\r\n  TUTUS SI FORTIS, and over his arms a Turk\u2019s
        head on a dagger, by way\r\n  of crest, which he won by his valour in fighting
        against that people\r\n  in the German war. On this monument is the following
        inscription:\r\n\r\n      Sacred to the immortal memory of Sir Palmes Fairborne,
        Knt.\r\n      Governor of Tangier, in execution of which command, he was\r\n
        \     mortally wounded by a shot from the Moors, then besieging the\r\n      town,
        in the 46th year of his age, October 24, 1680.\r\n\r\n  His epitaph, wrote
        by Mr. Dryden, runs thus:\r\n\r\n           Ye sacred reliques, which your
        marble keep,\r\n           Here undisturb\u2019d by wars, in quiet sleep:\r\n
        \          Discharge the trust, which (when it was below) }\r\n           Fairborne\u2019s
        undaunted soul did undergo,        }\r\n           And be the town\u2019s
        palladium from the foe.      }\r\n           Alive and dead these walls he
        will defend:\r\n           Great actions great examples must attend.\r\n           The
        Candian siege his early valour knew,\r\n           Where Turkish blood did
        his young hands imbrue;\r\n           From thence returning, with deserv\u2019d
        applause,     }\r\n           Against the Moors his well-flesh\u2019d sword
        he draws, }\r\n           The same the courage, and the same the cause.      }\r\n
        \          His youth and age, his life and death combine,     }\r\n           As
        in some great and regular design,               }\r\n           All of a piece
        throughout, and all divine.         }\r\n           Still nearer heav\u2019n
        his virtue shone more bright,  }\r\n           Like rising flames expanding
        in their height,      }\r\n           The martyr\u2019s glory crown\u2019d
        the soldier\u2019s fight.    }\r\n           More bravely British General
        never fell,\r\n           Nor General\u2019s death was e\u2019er reveng\u2019d
        so well,\r\n           Which his pleas\u2019d eyes beheld before their close,\r\n
        \          Follow\u2019d by thousand victims of his foes.\r\n             To
        his lamented loss, for times to come,\r\n             His pious widow consecrates
        this tomb.\r\n\r\n  26. On a table monument enriched with military trophies,
        and raised\r\n  against the wall, is the following inscription:\r\n\r\n      To
        the memory of the honoured Major Richard Creed, who\r\n      attended his
        Majesty King William the Third in all his wars,\r\n      every where signalizing
        himself, and never more himself than\r\n      when he looked an enemy in the
        face. At the glorious battle of\r\n      Blenheim, Ann. Dom. 1704, he commanded
        those squadrons that\r\n      began the attack; in two several charges he
        remained unhurt;\r\n      but in a third, after many wounds received, still
        valiantly\r\n      fighting, he was shot through the head. His dead body was\r\n
        \     brought off by his brother, at the hazard of his own life, and\r\n      buried
        there. To his memory his sorrowful mother erects this\r\n      monument, placing
        it near another which her son, when living,\r\n      used to look upon with
        pleasure, for the worthy mention it\r\n      makes of that great man Edward
        Earl of Sandwich, to whom he\r\n      had the honour to be related, and whose
        heroic virtues he was\r\n      ambitious to imitate.\r\n\r\n  27. The monument
        of Sir John Chardin, who distinguished himself by his\r\n  travels into the
        east, is adorned with a globe, which exhibits a view\r\n  of the different
        countries he visited, and around it are represented a\r\n  number of geographical
        instruments.\r\n\r\n  28. The monument of Sidney Earl of Godolphin is adorned
        with a bust\r\n  richly dressed, and has an inscription which mentions the
        employments\r\n  and honours through which he passed. He died on September
        15, 1712,\r\n  aged sixty-seven.\r\n\r\n  29. The next is a double monument
        erected to the memory of Sir Charles\r\n  Harbord, and Clement Cottrel, Esq;
        On the base is represented in\r\n  relievo a dreadful sea-fight, and on the
        top in a wreath of laurel is\r\n  this inscription, \u201CTo preserve and
        unite the memory of two faithful\r\n  friends, who lost their lives at sea
        together, May 28, 1672.\u201D These\r\n  two young gentlemen both perished
        in the Royal James, with the Earl of\r\n  Sandwich, who commanded in that
        ship as Vice-Admiral against the Dutch\r\n  in that memorable fight off the
        coast of Sussex in the reign of King\r\n  Charles II. The Royal James being
        set on fire, Sir Charles Harbord,\r\n  first Lieutenant, though he might have
        saved himself by swimming as\r\n  many others did, yet out of pure affection
        to his worthy Commander,\r\n  chose to die with him. Young Cottrel was a volunteer,
        and after being\r\n  the first man who had boarded a Dutch ship of 70 guns,
        and pulled down\r\n  her ensign with his own hands, returned to the Royal
        James unwounded,\r\n  and also perished with his friends. This gentleman understood
        seven\r\n  languages, tho\u2019 but twenty-two years of age. This moving story
        is\r\n  recited at large on the monument.\r\n\r\n  30. A tomb erected to the
        memory of Anne Fielding, the first wife of\r\n  Sir Samuel Morland, Knt. and
        Bart. chiefly remarkable for having two\r\n  very learned inscriptions: the
        first, in Hebrew, is to this effect:\r\n\r\n      O thou fairest among women!
        O virtuous woman! The hand of the\r\n      Lord hath done this.\r\n\r\n      The
        Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the\r\n      name of the
        Lord.\r\n\r\n  Under this is an Ethiopic inscription, which has been thus
        translated:\r\n\r\n      Come let us lament over this monument, raised for
        thee by a\r\n      beloved husband; but in certain hope that thou art united
        with\r\n      Christ.\r\n\r\n      This Lady was truly religious, virtuous,
        faithful, and, as a\r\n      dove, mild and chaste; while she continued in
        life, she was\r\n      honoured, and, through mercy, is happy in death.\r\n\r\n
        \ Under the Ethiopic is this inscription in English:\r\n\r\n      Anne, daughter
        to George Fielding, Esq; and of Mary his wife,\r\n      the truly loving (and
        as truly beloved) wife of Samuel\r\n      Morland, Knt. and Bart. died Feb.
        20, Ann. Dom. 1679\u201380.\r\n\r\n  31. Near this last is a tomb much in
        the same taste, erected to the\r\n  memory of Carola Harsnet, the second wife
        of the same Baronet, who\r\n  died in child-bed of her second son, Oct. 10,
        1674, in the 23d year of\r\n  her age. Here are two inscriptions, the first
        in Hebrew, and the other\r\n  in Greek, which have been thus translated:\r\n\r\n
        \     Blessed be the Lord, my wife was precious: blessed be thy\r\n      remembrance,
        O virtuous woman.\r\n\r\n      When I think of thy mildness, patience, charity,
        modesty, and\r\n      piety, I lament thee, O most excellent creature, and
        grieve\r\n      exceedingly: but not like such as have no faith; for I believe\r\n
        \     and expect the resurrection of those who sleep in Christ.\r\n\r\n  32.
        Between the two former is a beautiful monument to the memory of\r\n  John
        Smith, Esq; a fine bust in relievo of that gentleman, is\r\n  supported by
        a weeping figure representing his daughter, both which\r\n  are designed and
        executed with great judgment and spirit. The Lady\r\n  sits upon an urn, which,
        with its base and a pyramid behind, unite the\r\n  whole in a most harmonious
        and agreeable stile. On the base is a Latin\r\n  inscription, setting forth
        his descent and issue.\r\n\r\n  33. Over the door that opens into the cloisters
        is a noble and elegant\r\n  monument erected for General Wade. In the center
        is a beautiful marble\r\n  pillar, enriched with military trophies most exquisitely
        wrought. The\r\n  principal figures, are Fame pushing back Time, who is eagerly\r\n
        \ approaching to demolish the pillar, with all the ensigns of honour,\r\n
        \ with which it is adorned; the General\u2019s head is in a medalion, and
        the\r\n  whole is executed with great beauty and elegance. The inscription\r\n
        \ underneath runs thus:\r\n\r\n      To the memory of George Wade, Field-Marshal
        of his Majesty\u2019s\r\n      forces, Lieutenant-General of the ordnance,
        Colonel of his\r\n      Majesty\u2019s third Regiment of Dragoon guards, Governor
        of\r\n      Fort-William, Fort-Augustus, and Fort-George, and one of his\r\n
        \     Majesty\u2019s most honourable Privy Council. He died March 14,\r\n
        \     1748, aged seventy-five.\r\n\r\n  34. A plain neat monument erected
        to the memory of Robert Cannon, D.\r\n  D. Dean of Lincoln, and Prebendary
        of this church, who died on the\r\n  28th of March 1722, aged fifty-nine.\r\n\r\n
        \ 35. An elegant monument of Mrs. Katharine Bovey. Faith is here\r\n  represented
        with her book closed, and Wisdom lamenting the death of\r\n  her Patroness,
        between which is the Lady\u2019s head in relief enclosed in\r\n  an annulet
        of black marble curiously veined. The inscription, which is\r\n  in English,
        gives an excellent character of the deceased, who died on\r\n  the 21st of
        January 1726, in the seventy-second year of her age; and\r\n  informs us that
        Mrs. Mary Pope, who lived with her near forty years,\r\n  in perfect friendship,
        erected this monument to her memory.\r\n\r\n  36. A small table monument to
        the memory of Mr. Henry Wharton, which\r\n  is only remarkable an account
        of the distinguished character of the\r\n  person whose name is inscribed
        upon it. Mr. Wharton was Rector of\r\n  Chartham in Kent, Vicar of the church
        of Minster in the Isle of\r\n  Thanet, Chaplain to Archbishop Sancroft, and
        one of the most\r\n  voluminous writers of his years. He died on the 3d of
        March 1694, aged\r\n  only thirty-one, and was so universally respected by
        the Bishops and\r\n  Clergy, that Archbishop Tillotson, and several other
        prelates, with a\r\n  vast body of the clergy, the choir and King\u2019s scholars,
        all in solemn\r\n  procession attended his funeral, and joined in an anthem
        composed on\r\n  this occasion by the great Purcell.\r\n\r\n  37. A plain
        neat monument erected to the memory of Dr. Thomas Spratt,\r\n  Bishop of Rochester,
        who died in 1713, aged seventy seven, and of his\r\n  son Mr. Thomas Spratt,
        Archdeacon of Rochester, and Prebendary of the\r\n  churches of Rochester,
        Winchester, and Westminster, whose remains lie\r\n  near those of his father.
        This monument was erected by John Friend, M.\r\n  D. as a testimony of his
        respect for those two worthy personages.\r\n\r\n  38. A monument for Sir Lumley
        Robinson, Bart. of Kentwell-Hall in\r\n  Suffolk, who by an untimely death
        ended his life Aug. 6, 1684, aged\r\n  thirty-six. It is adorned with columns
        supported by death\u2019s heads, and\r\n  the arms upon the base by a cherub.
        The sides of the pediment have\r\n  enrichments of laurel branches, &c. and
        on the top is a vase.\r\n\r\n  39. The monument of John Friend, M. D. has
        an admirable bust of that\r\n  gentleman, standing on a pedestal of fine white
        veined marble, and\r\n  under it is a long inscription in Latin, setting forth
        the\r\n  distinguished acquirements, and great abilities of that eminent\r\n
        \ physician.\r\n\r\n  40. Mr. Congreve\u2019s monument has an half length
        marble portrait of that\r\n  gentleman, placed on a pedestal of fine Egyptian
        marble, and enriched\r\n  with emblematical devices relating to the drama.
        Underneath is this\r\n  inscription in English:\r\n\r\n      Mr. William Congreve
        died January 19, 1728, aged fifty-six,\r\n      and was buried near this place.
        To whose most valuable memory\r\n      this monument is set up by Henrietta
        Duchess of Marlborough,\r\n      as a mark how dearly she remembers the happiness
        she enjoyed\r\n      in the sincere friendship of so worthy and honest a man;
        whose\r\n      virtue, candour and wit, gained him the love and esteem of
        the\r\n      present age; and whose writings will be the admiration of the\r\n
        \     future.\r\n\r\n  41. The monument of the Right Hon. James Craggs, Esq;
        his statue is\r\n  represented leaning on an urn, and was one of the first
        in the Abbey\r\n  represented standing. The inscription, which is in golden
        characters,\r\n  shews that he was Principal Secretary of state, and a man
        universally\r\n  beloved, which is there particularly remarked, because as
        he was only\r\n  a shoe-maker\u2019s son, it is the more surprizing that in
        the high station\r\n  to which he was raised by his merit, he should escape
        envy, and\r\n  acquire the general esteem. He died on the 16th of February
        1720. Upon\r\n  the base of this monument are the following lines, written
        by Mr.\r\n  Pope:\r\n\r\n             Statesman, yet friend to truth, of soul
        sincere,\r\n             In action faithful, and in honour clear!\r\n             Who
        broke no promise, serv\u2019d no private end;\r\n             Who gain\u2019d
        no title, and who lost no friend;\r\n             Ennobled by himself, by
        all approved;\r\n             Prais\u2019d, wept, and honour\u2019d by the
        Muse he lov\u2019d.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _S. Wale delin_ _C. Grignion
        sc._ _Cap^t. Cornwall\u2019s\r\n  Monument_]\r\n\r\n\r\n  42. On the south
        side of the great west entrance is a noble monument\r\n  erected to the memory
        of the brave Captain Cornwall, who after\r\n  distinguishing himself by his
        heroism, was unhappily slain in the\r\n  battle between the English fleet,
        commanded by the Admirals Matthews\r\n  and Lestock, and the French. This
        monument was erected to his honour\r\n  by order of Parliament, and is a noble
        testimony of the public\r\n  gratitude for his distinguished merit. On the
        back is a lofty pyramid\r\n  of Egyptian marble beautifully variegated, and
        finely polished,\r\n  standing on a base of the same marble. Upon this base
        is a rock of\r\n  white marble, along the different parts of which run sea
        weeds. Near\r\n  the top stands a fine figure of Fame, placing a medalion
        of the\r\n  Captain on the summit of the rock, underneath which is a naval
        crown,\r\n  a globe, the trumpet of Fame, and other ornaments, and behind
        rises to\r\n  the top of the pediment a palm, entwined with a laurel. On the
        other\r\n  side of the medalion stands a beautiful figure of Britannia, with
        the\r\n  British Lion couchant at her feet. Beneath, in an opening of the
        rock,\r\n  is a Latin inscription on a fine piece of polished porphyry,\r\n
        \ mentioning his descent, and the manner of his death, which happened\r\n
        \ while fighting for his country, on the 3d of February 1743, in the\r\n  45th
        year of his age, and that the Senate of Britain consecrated this\r\n  monument
        to his memory. In another opening of the rock, a little\r\n  lower, is represented
        in bass relief a view of the engagement in which\r\n  this great man perished,
        and at the bottom of the rock on the sides\r\n  lie cannons, flags, anchors,
        &c. all of white marble.\r\n\r\n  43. The next is an elegant monument for
        Sir Thomas Hardy, Knt. On the\r\n  back is a lofty pyramid of a bluish coloured
        marble, at the foot of\r\n  which the statue of the deceased is placed, reclining
        upon a tomb of\r\n  elegant workmanship, with a naked boy on his left side
        weeping over an\r\n  urn: the enrichments round the pedestal on which he stands
        are just\r\n  and proper; and the inscription contains the following short
        history\r\n  of his life:\r\n\r\n      Sir THOMAS HARDY, to whose memory this
        monument is erected,\r\n      was bred in the royal navy from his youth, and
        was made a\r\n      Captain in 1693.\r\n\r\n      In the expedition to Cadiz,
        under Sir George Rooke, he\r\n      commanded the Pembroke; and when the fleet
        left the coast of\r\n      Spain, to return to England, he was ordered to
        Lagos Bay,\r\n      where he got intelligence of the Spanish galleons being\r\n
        \     arrived in the harbour of Vigo, under convoy of seventeen\r\n      French
        men of war: by his great diligence and judgment he\r\n      joined the English
        fleet, and gave the Admiral that\r\n      intelligence which engaged him to
        make the best of his way to\r\n      Vigo, where all the aforementioned galleons
        and men of war\r\n      were either taken or destroyed.\r\n\r\n      After
        the success of that action, the Admiral sent him with an\r\n      account
        of it to the Queen, who ordered him a considerable\r\n      present, and knighted
        him.\r\n\r\n      Some years afterwards he was made a Rear-Admiral, and received\r\n
        \     several other marks of favour and esteem from her Majesty, and\r\n      from
        her Royal Consort Prince George of Denmark, Lord High\r\n      Admiral of
        England.\r\n\r\n  44. The monument of John Conduit, Esq; is allowed, in point
        of design,\r\n  to be not inferior to that last mentioned, and there is something
        in\r\n  the manner which shews them both to be the workmanship of the same\r\n
        \ hand. In the middle of the pyramid is a large medalion of brass, round\r\n
        \ which is a Latin inscription, thus english\u2019d, JOHN CONDUIT, MASTER
        OF\r\n  THE MINT; this medalion is suspended by a cherub above, and rests
        on\r\n  another below. This gentleman succeeded his relation the great Sir\r\n
        \ Isaac Newton in that office, and desired to be interred near him, as\r\n
        \ appears from a long Latin inscription on the base. He died May 23d,\r\n
        \ 1727, aged forty-nine. Catharine his wife died Jan. 20, 1739, and lies\r\n
        \ interred under the same tomb.\r\n\r\n  45. The monument of William Horneck,
        Esq; is enriched with books,\r\n  plans, and instruments of fortification,
        alluding to the employments\r\n  of the deceased; who was chief engineer to
        the royal train of\r\n  artillery, and, as his inscription informs us, learned
        the art of war\r\n  under the great Duke of Marlborough. He died May 10, 1743.\r\n\r\n
        \ 46. The monument of Sir Godfrey Kneller, Knt. has a bust of Sir\r\n  Godfrey
        under a canopy of state, the curtains of which are gilt and\r\n  tied with
        golden strings, and on each side the bust is a weeping\r\n  Cupid, one resting
        on a framed picture, the other holding a painter\u2019s\r\n  pallat and pencils.
        This monument is not however much esteemed.\r\n\r\n  On the pedestal is a
        Latin inscription, signifying that Sir Godfrey\r\n  Kneller, Knt. who lies
        interred here, was painter to King Charles II.\r\n  King James II. King William
        III. Queen Anne, and King George I.\r\n  Underneath is his epitaph written
        by Mr. Pope, which has been also\r\n  much censured:\r\n\r\n             Kneller!
        by Heav\u2019n, and not a master taught!\r\n             Whose art was nature,
        and whose pictures thought;\r\n             Now for two ages having snatch\u2019d
        from fate\r\n             Whate\u2019er was beauteous, or whate\u2019er was
        great,\r\n             Rests crown\u2019d with Princes\u2019 honours, Poets\u2019
        lays,\r\n             Due to his merit, and brave thirst of praise.\r\n             Living,
        great Nature fear\u2019d he might outvie\r\n             Her works; and dying,
        fears herself may die.\r\n\r\n  47. We come now to the monument of Anna Countess
        Dowager of\r\n  Clanrikard, which is adorned with excellent carving, and a
        fine statue\r\n  of that Lady resting upon a tomb. The inscription gives an
        account of\r\n  her descent, marriages, and issue, and informs us, that she
        died on\r\n  the 14th of January 1732, in the 49th year of her age.\r\n\r\n
        \ 48. The monument of John Woodward, M. D. is a very beautiful one, and\r\n
        \ the figures most admirably finished. The head of the deceased is\r\n  represented
        in profile, in a very masterly manner, and the Lady who\r\n  holds it is inimitably
        performed. The inscription contains a panegyric\r\n  on the parts and learning
        of the deceas\u2019d.\r\n\r\n  49. A neat plain monument erected to the memory
        of Heneage Twisden, a\r\n  young hero, who fell in the battle of Blairgnies
        in Hainault, while he\r\n  was Aid de Camp to John Duke of Argyle, who commanded
        the right wing\r\n  of the Confederate army. He was the seventh son of Sir
        William\r\n  Twisden, Bart. and a youth of the greatest expectations; but
        the\r\n  fortune of war put a stop to his rising merit, in 1709, and in the\r\n
        \ 29th year of his age.\r\n\r\n  Near this monument are two small ones to
        the memory of two of his\r\n  brothers, Josiah and John; Josiah was a Captain
        at the siege of\r\n  Agremont, near Lisle in Flanders, and was slain by a
        cannon shot in\r\n  1708, at twenty-three years of age. John was a Lieutenant
        in the\r\n  Admiral\u2019s ship, under Sir Cloudesly Shovel, and perished
        with him in\r\n  1707, aged twenty-three.\r\n\r\n  50. A monument erected
        in honour of Col. James Bringfield, ornamented\r\n  with military trophies,
        cherubs, &c. and surrounded by a mantling\r\n  enclosing a tablet, on which
        is inscribed the military preferments of\r\n  the deceased, the manner of
        his death and burial, and the praises of\r\n  his piety and virtue. He was
        born at Abingdon in Berks, was Equerry to\r\n  Prince George of Denmark, and
        Aid de Camp to the Great Duke of\r\n  Marlborough; but was killed by a cannon
        ball, as he was remounting his\r\n  General on a fresh horse, at the battle
        of Ramelies, May 12, 1706, and\r\n  was interred at Barechem in Brabant, in
        the 50th year of his age.\r\n\r\n  51. The monument of Mr. Killegrew has been
        reckoned one of the best\r\n  pieces of sculpture in the whole church, and
        what is remarkable, is\r\n  cut out of one stone. The embellishments are distinct
        and very\r\n  picturesque, and the inscription, short, modest, and soldier-like.
        It\r\n  is as follows:\r\n\r\n      Robert Killegrew, of Arwenack in Cornwall,
        Esq; son of Thomas\r\n      and Charlotte, Page of honour to King Charles
        II. Brigadier\r\n      General of her Majesty\u2019s forces, killed in Spain
        in the battle\r\n      of Almanza, April 14, 1707. \xC6tatis fu\xE6 47. MILITAVI
        ANNIS 24.\r\n\r\n  52. The next is a monument erected to the memory of Mrs.
        Mary Beaufoy,\r\n  who is represented in a devout posture, with cherubs crowning
        her: on\r\n  each side are Cupids lamenting the early decay of a virgin beauty,
        and\r\n  underneath the arms of her family quarterly upheld by cherubs. On
        the\r\n  base is the following inscription:\r\n\r\n      Reader! whoever thou
        art, let the sight of this tomb imprint\r\n      in thy mind, that the young
        and old without distinction, leave\r\n      this world; and therefore fail
        not to secure the next. This\r\n      Lady was only daughter and heiress to
        Sir Henry Beaufoy, of\r\n      Guyscliffe, near Warwick, by the Hon. Charlotte
        Lane, eldest\r\n      daughter of George Lord Viscount Lansborough. She died
        July\r\n      12, 1705.\r\n\r\n  53. After passing by a few monuments unworthy
        of notice, we come to\r\n  that of Admiral Baker, adorned with a rostral column
        of curiously\r\n  veined marble, decorated with the prows of galleys, a Medusa\u2019s
        head,\r\n  and other naval and military trophies, with this short inscription\r\n
        \ underneath:\r\n\r\n      To the memory of John Baker, Esq; Vice-Admiral
        of the White\r\n      Squadron of the British Fleet; who, when he commanded
        in the\r\n      Mediterranean, died at Port Mahon, Nov. 10, 1736, aged\r\n
        \     fifty-six. He was a brave, judicious and experienced officer;\r\n      a
        sincere friend, and a true lover of his country.\r\n\r\n        _Manet post
        Funera Virtus._\r\n\r\n  54. Next to this is Mr. Priestman\u2019s monument,
        to which is suspended by\r\n  a knot of ribbons, fastened to a column of variegated
        marble, a fine\r\n  medalion, with the words HENRY PRIESTMAN, Esq; round the
        head.\r\n  Underneath are naval trophies and sea instruments; and upon the
        base\r\n  is an inscription, shewing that the person to whom this monument
        is\r\n  erected, was Commander in chief of a squadron of ships of war in the\r\n
        \ reign of King Charles II. a Commissioner of the Navy, and one of the\r\n
        \ Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral of England\r\n
        \ in the reign of King William III. He died Aug. 20, 1712, aged 65.\r\n\r\n
        \ 55. The monument of Philip Carteret, son to Lord George Carteret, who\r\n
        \ died a King\u2019s scholar at Westminster, ripe for the university, on the\r\n
        \ 19th of March 1710, aged nineteen. On the upper part is an admirable\r\n
        \ bust of this noble youth, and underneath a very fine figure of Time\r\n
        \ standing on an altar, and holding a scroll in his hand, whereon is\r\n  written
        in Sapphic verses, lines to the following import, which he is\r\n  supposed
        to be repeating:\r\n\r\n                Why flows the mournful Muse\u2019s
        tear,\r\n                  For thee! cut down in life\u2019s full prime?\r\n
        \               Why sighs, for thee, the parent dear!\r\n                  Cropt
        by the scythe of hoary Time?\r\n\r\n                Lo! this, my Boy\u2019s
        the common lot!\r\n                  To me thy memory entrust;\r\n                When
        all that\u2019s dear shall be forgot,\r\n                  I\u2019ll guard
        thy venerable dust.\r\n\r\n                From age to age, as I proclaim\r\n
        \                 Thy learning, piety, and truth;\r\n                Thy great
        example shall enflame;\r\n                  And emulation raise in youth.\r\n\r\n
        \ 56. A neat monument erected for Edward de Carteret, the son of Sir\r\n  Edward
        de Carteret, Gentleman Usher to King Charles II. who died on\r\n  the 30th
        of October 1677, in the eighth year of his age. It is\r\n  ornamented with
        cherubs and with festoons of leaves and fruit.\r\n\r\n  57. The monument of
        Thomas Levingston, Viscount Teviot, is decorated\r\n  with the arms, supporters,
        and crest of that nobleman, and with\r\n  military trophies, alluding to his
        profession of a soldier. On the\r\n  face of the monument is a long inscription
        in Latin, shewing that he\r\n  was born in Holland, but descended from the
        Levingstons in Scotland;\r\n  that from his childhood he was trained to arms;
        and having attended\r\n  the Prince of Orange into Britain, as a Colonel of
        foot, rose to the\r\n  rank of a Lieutenant-General in the army, and General
        of the Scotch\r\n  forces, was made Master of the ordnance, and a Privy Counsellor;
        that\r\n  he secured Scotland to the King by one decisive action on the Spey,\r\n
        \ for which he was advanced to the dignity of a Viscount, and that he\r\n
        \ died on the 14th of Jan. 1710, aged sixty.\r\n\r\n  58. A handsome monument
        erected for the Lord Constable, ornamented\r\n  with a cherub below, and the
        family arms above. It has this short\r\n  inscription:\r\n\r\n      Near this
        lies the Right Hon. Robert Lord Constable, Viscount\r\n      Dunbar, who departed
        this life Nov. 23, 1714, in the\r\n      sixty-fourth year of his age.\r\n\r\n
        \ 59. A plain neat monument for Peter Heylin, D.D. and Prebendary of\r\n  this
        church, who died on the 8th of May 1662. It is adorned with a\r\n  pediment,
        and the arms of the deceased, and contains a long\r\n  inscription in Latin,
        mentioning the most remarkable incidents in his\r\n  life.\r\n\r\n  60. The
        tomb of Charles Williams, Esq; adorned with very remarkable\r\n  scroll-work,
        and scollopping; what is very singular is, its being\r\n  supported by a death\u2019s
        head on the wings of Time. This gentleman died\r\n  on the 29th of August
        1720, aged eighty-seven.\r\n\r\n  61. A small but elegant monument erected
        to the memory of the\r\n  celebrated Henry Purcell, Esq; well known by his
        admirable musical\r\n  compositions. The inscription consists of this short
        and comprehensive\r\n  sentence:\r\n\r\n               Here lies Henry Purcell,
        who left this life,\r\n                 and is gone to that blessed place,
        where\r\n                   only his harmony can be exceeded. He\r\n                  died
        Nov. 21, 1697, in his 37th year.\r\n\r\n  62. The next is the monument of
        William Croft, Doctor in music. On the\r\n  pedestal is an organ in bas relief,
        and on the top, a bust of the\r\n  deceased,\r\n\r\n  63. The tomb of John
        Blow, Doctor in music, is adorned with cherubs,\r\n  flowers, and a canon
        in four parts set to music. In the center is an\r\n  English inscription,
        by which it appears he was organist, composer,\r\n  and master to the children
        in the chapel royal thirty-five years, and\r\n  organist to this Abbey fifteen
        years; that he was scholar to Dr.\r\n  Christopher Gibbons; and master to
        the famous Mr. Purcell, and to most\r\n  of the eminent masters of his time.
        He died Oct. 1. 1708, in his\r\n  sixtieth year; and his epitaph observes,
        that his own musical\r\n  compositions, especially his church music, are a
        far nobler monument\r\n  to his memory than any other that can be raised to
        him.\r\n\r\n  64. We come now to the neat and elegant monument erected to
        the memory\r\n  of Dr. Boulter, Archbishop of Armagh in Ireland. It is of
        the finest\r\n  marble beautified with an admirable new invented polish. The
        bust of\r\n  this worthy Archbishop is finely executed; his long flowing hair
        has\r\n  all the gracefulness of nature, without the smallest degree of that\r\n
        \ stiffness which belongs to stone; and his venerable countenance\r\n  strikes
        the beholder with reverence. The ensigns of his dignity\r\n  wherewith the
        monument is adorned, are most exquisitely fine, and\r\n  every part about
        it discovers a masterly genius in the sculptor. The\r\n  inscription is inclosed
        in a beautiful border of porphyry, and is as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n      Dr.
        Hugh Boulter, late Archbishop of Armagh, Primate of all\r\n      Ireland,
        a Prelate so eminent for the accomplishments of his\r\n      mind, the purity
        of his heart, and the excellence of his life,\r\n      that it may be thought
        superfluous to specify his titles,\r\n      recount his virtues, or even erect
        a monument to his fame. His\r\n      titles he not only deserved, but adorned;
        his virtues are\r\n      manifest in his good works, which had never dazzled
        the public\r\n      eye, if they had not been too bright to be concealed;
        and as\r\n      to his fame, whosoever has any sense of merit, any reverence\r\n
        \     for piety, any passion for his country, or any charity for\r\n      mankind,
        will assist in preserving it fair and spotless, that\r\n      when brass and
        marble shall mix with the dust they cover,\r\n      every succeeding age may
        have the benefit of his illustrious\r\n      example. He was born Jan. 4,
        1671, was consecrated Bishop of\r\n      Bristol, 1718, translated to the
        Archbishopric of Armagh,\r\n      1723, and from thence to Heaven, Sept. 27,
        1742.\r\n\r\n  65. A plain table monument erected to the memory of Dr. Samuel\r\n
        \ Bradford, Bishop of Rochester, who died on the 14th of May 1731, in\r\n
        \ the seventy-ninth year of his age. It contains a long Latin\r\n  inscription
        scarce legible, surrounded with the arms, and proper\r\n  ensigns of his several
        dignities.\r\n\r\n  66. The next is a monument erected to the memory of Richard
        Kane, Esq;\r\n  Governor of Minorca, adorned with a curious bust of that gentleman
        in\r\n  white marble, placed upon a handsome pedestal, whereon are inscribed\r\n
        \ the most remarkable passages of his life. He was born at Down in\r\n  Ireland,
        Dec. 20, 1661. In 1689 he first appeared in a military\r\n  capacity at the
        memorable siege of Derry; and after the reduction of\r\n  Ireland, followed
        King William into Flanders, where he distinguished\r\n  himself, particularly
        by his intrepid behaviour at the siege of Namur,\r\n  where he was grievously
        wounded. In 1702, he bore a commission in the\r\n  service of Queen Anne,
        and assisted in the expedition to Canada; from\r\n  whence he again returned
        into Flanders, and fought under the Duke of\r\n  Argyle and Greenwich, and
        afterwards under Lord Carpenter. In 1712, he\r\n  was made Sub-Governor of
        Minorca, through which island he caused a\r\n  road to be made, which had
        been thought impracticable. In 1720 he was\r\n  ordered by King George I.
        to the defence of Gibraltar, where he\r\n  sustained an eight months siege
        against the Spaniards, when all hope\r\n  of relief was extinguished. For
        which gallant service he was\r\n  afterwards, by King George II. rewarded
        with the government of\r\n  Minorca, where he died Dec. 19, 1736, and was
        buried in the castle of\r\n  St. Philip.\r\n\r\n  67. The monument of Percy
        Kirk, Esq; is adorned with a fine bust of\r\n  that gentleman, on each side
        of which is a winged seraph, one with a\r\n  dagger in his right hand inverted,
        and in his left a helmet; the other\r\n  resting on a ball, and holding in
        his left hand a torch reversed. The\r\n  inscription lets us know, that he
        was Lieutenant-General of his\r\n  Majesty\u2019s armies; that he was son
        to Percy Kirk, Lieutenant-General in\r\n  the reign of King James II. by the
        Lady Mary, daughter to George\r\n  Howard Earl of Suffolk, and that he died
        Jan. 1, 1741, aged\r\n  fifty-seven.\r\n\r\n  68. We come now to the monument
        erected to the memory of that brave\r\n  commander the Lord Aubrey Beauclerk,
        ornamented with arms, trophies,\r\n  and naval ensigns, and in an oval nich
        on a beautiful pyramid of\r\n  dove-coloured marble, is a fine bust of that
        young Hero. On this\r\n  pyramid is the following historical inscription:\r\n\r\n
        \     The Lord Aubrey Beauclerk was the youngest son of Charles Duke\r\n      of
        St. Albans, by Diana, daughter of Aubrey de Vere Earl of\r\n      Oxford.
        He went early to sea, and was made a commander in\r\n      1731. In 1740,
        he was sent upon that memorable expedition to\r\n      Carthagena, under the
        command of Admiral Vernon, in his\r\n      Majesty\u2019s ship the Prince
        Frederic, which, with three others,\r\n      was ordered to cannonade the
        castle of Boccachica. One of\r\n      these being obliged to quit her station,
        the Prince Frederic\r\n      was exposed, not only to the fire from the castle,
        but to that\r\n      of Fort St. Joseph, and to two ships that guarded the
        mouth of\r\n      the harbour, which he sustained for many hours that day,
        and\r\n      part of the next, with uncommon intrepidity. As he was giving\r\n
        \     his commands upon deck, both his legs were shot off; but such\r\n      was
        his magnanimity, that he would not suffer his wounds to be\r\n      drest,
        till he communicated his orders to his first\r\n      Lieutenant, which were,
        _To fight his ship to the last\r\n      extremity_. Soon after this he gave
        some directions about his\r\n      private affairs, and then resigned his
        soul with the dignity\r\n      of a Hero and a Christian. Thus was he taken
        off in the\r\n      thirty-first year of his age, an illustrious commander
        of\r\n      superior fortitude and clemency, amiable in his person, steady\r\n
        \     in his affections, and equalled by few in the social and\r\n      domestic
        virtues of politeness, modesty, candour, and\r\n      benevolence. He married
        the widow of Col. Francis Alexander, a\r\n      daughter of Sir Henry Newton,
        Knt. Envoy Extraordinary to the\r\n      Court of Florence and the Republic
        of Genoa, and Judge of the\r\n      high court of Admiralty.\r\n\r\n  Over
        his inscription is the following epitaph:\r\n\r\n            Whilst Britain
        boasts her Empire o\u2019er the deep,\r\n            This marble shall compel
        the brave to weep;\r\n            As men, as Britons, and as soldiers mourn:\r\n
        \           \u2019Tis dauntless, loyal, virtuous Beauclerk\u2019s urn.\r\n
        \           Sweet were his manners, as his soul was great,\r\n            And
        ripe his worth, tho\u2019 immature his fate;\r\n            Each tender grace
        that joy and love inspires,\r\n            Living, he mingled with his martial
        fires;\r\n            Dying, he bid Britannia\u2019s thunder roar,\r\n            And
        Spain still felt him, when he breath\u2019d no more.\r\n\r\n  69. A beautiful
        monument erected to the memory of Admiral Balchen, on\r\n  which is his bust
        well executed in the finest white marble. The\r\n  enrichments, arms and trophies,
        are admirably wrought, but in\r\n  fastening the cable to the anchor this
        excellent artist has shewn that\r\n  he is no mariner. In the front is a fine
        representation of a ship in a\r\n  storm. The inscription is as follows:\r\n\r\n
        \     To the memory of Sir John Balchen, Knt. Admiral of the White\r\n      Squadron
        of his Majesty\u2019s fleet in 1744, being sent out\r\n      Commander in
        chief of the combined fleets of England and\r\n      Holland, to cruize on
        the enemy, was on his return home in his\r\n      Majesty\u2019s ship the
        Victory, lost in the Channel by a violent\r\n      storm; from which sad circumstance
        of his death we may learn,\r\n      that neither the greatest skill, judgment,
        or experience,\r\n      joined to the most firm unshaken resolution, can resist
        the\r\n      fury of the winds and waves; and we are taught from the\r\n      passages
        of his life, which were filled with great and gallant\r\n      actions, but
        ever accompanied with adverse gales of fortune,\r\n      that the brave, the
        worthy and the good man, meets not always\r\n      his reward in this world.
        Fifty-eight years of faithful and\r\n      painful services he had passed,
        when being just retired to the\r\n      government of Greenwich Hospital to
        wear out the remainder of\r\n      his days, he was once more, and for the
        last time, called out\r\n      by his King and Country, whose interest he
        ever preferred to\r\n      his own, and his unwearied zeal for their service
        ended only\r\n      in his death; which weighty misfortune to his afflicted
        family\r\n      became heightened by many aggravating circumstances attending\r\n
        \     it; yet amidst their grief had they the mournful consolation\r\n      to
        find his gracious and royal Master mixing his concern with\r\n      the general
        lamentations of the public, for the calamitous\r\n      fate of so zealous,
        so valiant, and so able a Commander; and\r\n      as a lasting memorial of
        the sincere love and esteem borne by\r\n      his widow, to a most affectionate
        and worthy husband, this\r\n      honorary monument was erected by her. He
        was born Feb. 2,\r\n      1669, married Susannah, daughter of Col. Apreece
        of Washingly\r\n      in the County of Huntingdon. Died Oct. 7, 1744, leaving
        one\r\n      son and one daughter, the former of whom, George Balchen,\r\n
        \     survived him but a short time; for being sent to the West\r\n      Indies
        in 1745, Commander of his Majesty\u2019s ship the Pembroke,\r\n      he died
        in Barbadoes in December the same year, aged 28,\r\n      having walked in
        the steps, and imitated the virtue and\r\n      bravery of his good, but unfortunate
        father.\r\n\r\n  70. A noble and elegant monument erected in honour of General
        Guest.\r\n  It is adorned with a pyramid and base of the most beautiful Egyptian\r\n
        \ porphyry, ornamented with the finest enrichments, and on the latter is\r\n
        \ an admirable bust of the General of white marble. The whole is\r\n  executed
        in the most delicate and masterly manner. It has this short,\r\n  but apposite
        inscription:\r\n\r\n      Sacred to those virtues that adorn a Christian and
        a Soldier,\r\n      this marble perpetuates the memory of Lieut. Gen. Joshua\r\n
        \     Guest, who closed a service of sixty years by faithfully\r\n      defending
        Edinburgh castle against the Rebels, 1745.\r\n\r\n  71. The next worthy of
        notice is the elegant monument of Sir Charles\r\n  Wager. The principal figure
        here is that of Fame holding a portrait of\r\n  Sir Charles in relief, which
        is also supported by an infant Hercules.\r\n  The enrichments are naval trophies,
        instruments of war and navigation,\r\n  &c. on the base is represented in
        relief the destroying and taking of\r\n  the Spanish galleons in 1708, The
        inscription is as follows:\r\n\r\n                 To the memory of Sir CHARLES
        WAGER, Knt.\r\n        Admiral of the White, first Commissioner of the Admiralty,\r\n
        \                         And Privy Counsellor;\r\n                     A
        man of great natural talents,\r\n                      Who bore the highest
        commands,\r\n               And pass\u2019d through the greatest employments,\r\n
        \           With credit to himself, and honour to his country.\r\n                          He
        was in private life\r\n                 Humane, temperate, just, and bountiful:\r\n
        \                           In public station,\r\n                   Valiant,
        prudent, wise, and honest:\r\n                          Easy of access to
        all;\r\n                   Plain and unaffected in his manners,\r\n                   Steady
        and resolute in his conduct:\r\n               So remarkably happy in his
        presence of mind,\r\n                   That no danger ever discompos\u2019d
        him;\r\n                    Esteemed and favoured by his King;\r\n                   Beloved
        and honoured by his Country.\r\n                      He died 24 May 1743.
        Aged 77.\r\n\r\n  72. The next tomb in the Abbey that demands our attention,
        is that\r\n  erected to the memory of John Hollis Duke of Newcastle, by his\r\n
        \ daughter the Countess of Oxford. This is perhaps the loftiest and most\r\n
        \ costly of any in the Abbey. A pediment is supported by beautiful\r\n  columns
        of variegated marble. The Duke is represented resting upon a\r\n  sepulchral
        monument, holding in his right hand a General\u2019s staff, and\r\n  in his
        left a ducal coronet. On one side the base stands a statue of\r\n  Wisdom,
        on the other, of Sincerity. On the angles of the upper\r\n  compartment sit
        angels, and on the ascending sides of the pediment sit\r\n  two cherubs, one
        with an hour-glass, alluding to the admeasurement of\r\n  man\u2019s life
        by grains of sand; the other pointing upwards, where life\r\n  shall no longer
        be measured by hours and minutes. On the base is an\r\n  inscription enumerating
        his Grace\u2019s titles, and several employments;\r\n  his marriage and issue;
        and informing us that he was born Jan. 9,\r\n  1661\u20132, and died July
        15, 1711.\r\n\r\n  73. The monument of William Cavendish Duke of Newcastle
        is also very\r\n  pompous, but is in the old taste. Under a rich canopy of
        state lie, as\r\n  the inscription expresses it, \u201CThe loyal Duke of Newcastle,
        and his\r\n  Duchess, his second wife, by whom he had no issue: her name was\r\n
        \ Margaret Lucas, youngest sister to Lord Lucas of Colchester, a noble\r\n
        \ family; for all the brothers were valiant, and all the sisters\r\n  virtuous.
        The Duchess was a wise, witty, and learned Lady, which her\r\n  many books
        do well testify: She was a most virtuous, and a loving and\r\n  careful wife,
        and was with her Lord all the time of his banishment and\r\n  miseries; and
        when he came home, never parted from him in his solitary\r\n  retirements.\u201D
        This is the English inscription. The Latin gives his\r\n  titles and employments;
        and observes, that for his fidelity to King\r\n  Charles I. he was made Captain-General
        of the forces raised for his\r\n  service in the North, fought many battles,
        and generally came off\r\n  victorious; but that when the rebels prevailed
        (being one of the first\r\n  designed a sacrifice) he left his estate, and
        endured a long exile. It\r\n  then gives his issue by his first wife, and
        concludes with observing,\r\n  that he died Dec. 27, 1676, in his eighty-fourth
        year.\r\n\r\n  74. On the adjoining pillar is a neat tablet, on which is this\r\n
        \ inscription:\r\n\r\n      Grace, eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Mauleverer
        of Allerton\r\n      Mauleverer in Yorkshire, Bart. born 1622, married unto
        Col.\r\n      Scott, a member of the Hon. House of Commons 1644, and died\r\n
        \     Feb. 24, 1645.\r\n\r\n               He that will give my GRACE but
        what is hers,\r\n                 Must say her death has not\r\n                 Made
        only her dear SCOTT,\r\n               But Virtue, Worth, and Sweetness, widowers.\r\n\r\n
        \ 75. The monument of Dame Mary James is neatly ornamented with an urn,\r\n
        \ wreathed and crowned with a Viscount\u2019s coronet, on a handsome pedestal\r\n
        \ The inscription observes that this Lady was wife to Sir John James, of\r\n
        \ the ancient family of the Lords of Hostrick in Holland, and that she\r\n
        \ died Nov. 6, 1667.\r\n\r\n  76. A magnificent and elegant monument of white
        marble to the memory\r\n  of Sir Peter Warren, done by Roubiliac. Close to
        the wall is a large\r\n  flag hanging to the flag-staff, and spreading in
        very natural folds\r\n  behind the whole monument. Before it is a fine figure
        of Hercules\r\n  placing Sir Peter\u2019s bust on its pedestal; and on the
        other side,\r\n  Victory, with a laurel wreath in her hand, is seated gazing
        on the\r\n  bust with a look of melancholy mixed with admiration. Behind her
        a\r\n  Cornucopia pours out fruit, corn, the fleece, &c. and by it is a\r\n
        \ cannon, an anchor, and other decorations. The inscription is as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n
        \                          Sacred to the memory\r\n                           Of
        Sir PETER WARREN,\r\n                           Knight of the Bath,\r\n                     Vice-Admiral
        of the Red Squadron\r\n                          Of the British Fleet,\r\n
        \                        And Member of Parliament\r\n                 For
        the City and Liberty of Westminster.\r\n\r\n  And a little lower:\r\n\r\n
        \       He derived his descent from an ancient Family of IRELAND,\r\n           His
        fame and honours from his virtues and abilities.\r\n                   How
        eminently these were displayed,\r\n            With what vigilance and spirit
        they were exerted,\r\n      In the various services wherein he had the honour
        to command,\r\n                      And the happiness to conquer,\r\n             Will
        be more properly recorded in the annals of\r\n                              GREAT
        BRITAIN.\r\n              On this tablet, affection with truth may say,\r\n
        \               That deservedly esteemed in private life,\r\n             And
        universally renowned for his public conduct,\r\n                    The judicious
        and gallant officer\r\n            Possessed all the amiable qualities of
        the Friend,\r\n                    The Gentleman, and the Christian.\r\n                            But
        the ALMIGHTY,\r\n                          Whom alone he feared,\r\n         And
        whose gracious protection he had often experienced,\r\n             Was pleased
        to remove him from a life of honour\r\n                       To an eternity
        of happiness,\r\n        On the 29th day of July 1752, in the 49th year of
        his age.\r\n\r\n  On the bottom of the base:\r\n\r\n            Susannah,
        his afflicted wife, caused this monument\r\n                              to
        be erected.\r\n\r\n  77. The monument inscribed to the memory of Sir Gilbert
        Lort, of\r\n  Stackpole in Pembrokeshire, who died Sept. 19, 1698, was erected
        to\r\n  his memory by his sister Dame Elizabeth Campbell of Calder in\r\n
        \ Scotland. The author of _The Review of the public buildings_, &c.\r\n  observes,
        that the two boys here placed on each side a little tomb,\r\n  are in a very
        pretty taste, and a perfect contrast to each other; one\r\n  representing
        passionate, exclamatory grief, and the other still and\r\n  silent; and adds,
        \u201C\u2019Tis pity they are divided by so bad an ornament in\r\n  the middle:
        had they leaned on a single urn, which, in the antique\r\n  taste, might have
        been supposed to hold his ashes, they would have had\r\n  a fine effect, and
        challenged more admiration than many a more pompous\r\n  and expensive pile.\u201D\r\n\r\n
        \ 78. The monument erected to Hugh Chamberlayne, M.D. was some years ago\r\n
        \ esteemed one of the best pieces in the Abbey; but some of the later\r\n
        \ monuments greatly exceed it. The principal figure lies, as it were, at\r\n
        \ ease, upon a tomb stone, leaning upon his right arm, with his hand\r\n  upon
        his night cap, and his head uncovered. In his left hand, he holds\r\n  a book,
        to shew his intense application to study. On each side are the\r\n  emblems
        of Physic and Longevity; and over his head, is Fame descending\r\n  with a
        trumpet in one hand, and a wreath in the other. On the top are\r\n  weeping
        cherubs, and on the pedestal a long Latin inscription, which\r\n  mentions
        his great knowledge and industry in his profession, his\r\n  humanity in relieving
        the sick, and his affinities and connections in\r\n  social and private life.
        He died June 17, 1728, aged sixty-four.\r\n\r\n  79. The tomb of Almericus
        de Courcy, Baron of Kinsale, in Ireland, is\r\n  ornamented with the figure
        of his Lordship in armour, reposing himself\r\n  after the fatigues of an
        active life, under a gilded canopy. The\r\n  inscription shews, that he was
        descended from the famous John de\r\n  Courcy, Earl of Ulster, who in the
        reign of King John, in\r\n  consideration of his great valour, obtained the
        extraordinary\r\n  privilege for him and his heirs, of being covered in the
        King\u2019s\r\n  presence. Almericus de Courcy died Feb. 9, 1719, aged fifty-seven.\r\n\r\n
        \ 80. The monument of Sir Thomas Duppa is adorned with flowers and\r\n  foliage,
        and on the top with an urn wreathed. The inscription shews,\r\n  that Sir
        Thomas in his youth waited upon King Charles II. when Prince\r\n  of Wales,
        and at length became Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, in\r\n  which office
        he died April 25, 1694, aged 75.\r\n\r\n  81. We come now to a monument that
        has been much admired, and as much\r\n  censured, that of Dame Elizabeth Carteret,
        who died on the 26th of\r\n  March, 1717, aged fifty-two. This Lady is represented
        springing\r\n  upwards, with only one foot fixed to the earth, and a little
        winged\r\n  seraph descending to receive her; but the disproportions are so
        great\r\n  between them, that one cannot help thinking, that it is much more\r\n
        \ likely she should pull the aerial messenger down, than he raise her\r\n
        \ one inch from the ground; but what is still worse, her attitude is\r\n  such,
        that it is impossible she should know that he is coming to give\r\n  her a
        lift. Below her hovering on the base, is another of these\r\n  heavenly spirits
        unfolding a very indifferent epitaph.\r\n\r\n  82. We come now to the grand
        and magnificent monument of the great Sir\r\n  Isaac Newton, whose statue
        is formed recumbent, leaning his right arm\r\n  on four folios, thus titled
        DIVINITY, CHRONOLOGY, OPTICS, and PHIL:\r\n  PRIN: MATH: and pointing to a
        scroll supported by cherubs. Over him is\r\n  a large globe projecting from
        a pyramid behind, whereon is delineated\r\n  the course of the comet in 1680,
        with the signs, constellations and\r\n  planets. On this globe sits the figure
        of Astronomy, with her book\r\n  closed, in a very thoughtful composed and
        pensive mood. Beneath the\r\n  principal figure is a very fine bas relief,
        representing the various\r\n  labours in which Sir Isaac chiefly employed
        his time: such as\r\n  discovering the cause of gravitation, settling the
        principles of light\r\n  and colours, and reducing the coinage to a determined
        standard. The\r\n  inscription on the pedestal is in Latin, short, but full
        of meaning,\r\n  intimating, that by a spirit nearly divine, he solved on
        principles of\r\n  his own, the motion and figure of the planets, the paths
        of the\r\n  comets, and the ebbing and flowing of the sea; that he discovered
        the\r\n  dissimularity of the rays of light, and the properties of colours
        from\r\n  thence arising, which none but himself had ever dreamt of; that
        he was\r\n  a diligent, wise and faithful interpreter of nature, antiquity,
        and\r\n  the holy scriptures; that by his philosophy he maintained the dignity\r\n
        \ of the Supreme Being; and by the purity of his life, the simplicity of\r\n
        \ the gospel; and it concludes with a just exclamation, What reason have\r\n
        \ mortals to pride themselves in the existence of so great an ornament\r\n
        \ to the human race! He was born Dec. 25, 1642, and died in 1726.\r\n\r\n
        \ So noble a monument erected to real merit, is a greater honour to the\r\n
        \ nation than to the great genius for whom it was raised; in this light\r\n
        \ it is viewed by all Europe.\r\n\r\n  83. On the other side of the entrance
        into the choir is another lofty\r\n  and pompous monument. This last was erected
        to the memory of Earl\r\n  Stanhope, who is also represented leaning upon
        his arm in a recumbent\r\n  posture, holding in his right hand a General\u2019s
        staff, and in his left\r\n  a parchment scroll. Before him stands a cupid
        resting upon a shield.\r\n  Over a martial tent sits Minerva, holding in her
        right hand a javelin,\r\n  and in the other a scroll. Behind is a slender
        pyramid. On the middle\r\n  of the pedestal are two medalions, and on each
        side the pilasters one.\r\n  In short, under the principal figure is a Latin
        inscription,\r\n  displaying the merits of this great man, as a soldier, a
        statesman,\r\n  and a senator: observing, that in 1707, he concluded an advantageous\r\n
        \ peace with Spain; and the same year was sent Embassador to Charles\r\n  III.
        In 1708, he took Port Mahon: In 1710, he forced his way to the\r\n  gates
        of Madrid, and took possession of that capital: In 1715, being\r\n  of the
        Secret Committee, he impeached the Duke of Ormond. In 1717 he\r\n  was made
        first Commissioner of the treasury, and Chancellor of the\r\n  exchequer;
        and in July following was created a Peer. He died in 1721,\r\n  in the forty-seventh
        year of his age.\r\n\r\n  84. Mr. Thynne\u2019s monument has always been esteemed
        a very fine one.\r\n  That gentleman is represented dying, and at his feet
        is a boy weeping.\r\n  Underneath on a table of black marble in white letters
        is this short\r\n  inscription:\r\n\r\n      Thomas Thynne of Longleate in
        Com. Wilts, Esq; who was\r\n      barbarously murdered on Sunday the 12th
        of February, 1682.\r\n\r\n  And upon the pedestal the story of his murder
        is finely represented in\r\n  relief.\r\n\r\n  This last observation makes
        it necessary to give the particulars of\r\n  this murder, which we shall do
        from a very accurate, tho\u2019 small work,\r\n  from which we have obtained
        considerable assistance in the description\r\n  of many things relating to
        the Abbey. The above murder was conspired\r\n  by Count Koningsmark, and executed
        by three assassins hired for that\r\n  purpose, who shot this unhappy gentleman
        in Pall-Mall, in his own\r\n  coach. The motive was, to obtain the rich heiress
        of Northumberland in\r\n  marriage, who in her infancy had been betrothed
        to the Earl of Ogle,\r\n  but left a widow before consummation; and afterwards
        married to Mr.\r\n  Thynne; but being scarce fifteen, and her mother extremely
        tender of\r\n  her, and at the same time desirous of her having issue, prevailed
        upon\r\n  her husband to travel another year before he bedded her, in which
        time\r\n  she became acquainted with Koningsmark at the Court of Hanover.\r\n
        \ Whether she had ever given him any countenance is uncertain; but\r\n  having
        no grounds to hope to obtain her while her husband lived, he in\r\n  this
        villainous manner accomplished his death: the Lady, however,\r\n  detested
        this base and inhuman conduct, and soon after married the\r\n  great Duke
        of Somerset.\u2014At the time this happened, a report was spread\r\n  that
        Mr. Thynne had formerly debauched a woman of family and\r\n  character, on
        honourable pretences; but upon his uncle\u2019s leaving him\r\n  10,000_l._
        a year; he basely deserted her; whence arose the saying,\r\n  that _he had
        escaped his misfortune, if he had either married the Lady\r\n  he had lain
        with, or lain with the Lady he had married_. But we do not\r\n  pretend to
        insinuate that there was any truth in this story. It may\r\n  probably be
        only a cruel piece of defamation. _Historical Description\r\n  of Westminster
        Abbey._\r\n\r\n  85. The monument of Dame Grace Gethin, is ornamented with
        a figure of\r\n  a Lady devoutly kneeling, with a book in her right hand,
        and her left\r\n  on her breast; on each side is an angel, one holding over
        her head a\r\n  crown, and the other a chaplet; and on the ascending sides
        of the\r\n  pediment are two female figures in a mournful posture. It is adorned\r\n
        \ with three different coats of family arms, and on the base is an\r\n  English
        inscription, which also lets us know that she was married to\r\n  Sir Richard
        Gethin of Gethin Grott in Ireland; was famed for her\r\n  exemplary piety,
        and wrote a book of devotions, which Mr. Congreve has\r\n  complimented with
        a poem. She died Oct. 11, 1697, aged twenty-one.\r\n\r\n  86. A monument erected
        to the memory of two sisters, the daughters of\r\n  Ralph Freke of Hannington
        in Wilts, Esq; whose busts in relief\r\n  ornament the sides. The inscription
        observes, that the eldest, named\r\n  Elizabeth, was married to Percey Freke
        of West Bilney in Norfolk, and\r\n  died on the 7th of April 1714; that Judith
        the youngest married Robert\r\n  Austin of Tenterden in Kent, and died May
        19, 1716: and that they were\r\n  both the best of daughters, the best of
        wives, and the best of\r\n  mothers.\r\n\r\n  87. A large monument of black
        marble erected to the memory of Sir\r\n  Thomas Richardson, Lord Chief Justice
        of England in the reign of King\r\n  Charles I. He died in 1634, and his tomb
        is adorned with his effigy in\r\n  brass, lying in his robes, and his collar
        of S S.\r\n\r\n  88. An ancient monument raised to the memory of William Thynne
        of\r\n  Botterville, Esq.; it is of marble and alabaster gilt, and is adorned\r\n
        \ with the statue of that gentleman lying at full length. The\r\n  inscription
        informs us, that he was a polite gentleman, a great\r\n  traveller, and a
        brave soldier, and that he died on the 14th of March\r\n  1584.\r\n\r\n  89.
        A very handsome monument erected for that learned grammarian Dr.\r\n  Busby,
        master of Westminster school; who is represented in his gown,\r\n  looking
        earnestly at the inscription; holding in his right hand a pen,\r\n  and in
        his left a book open. Upon the pedestal underneath are a\r\n  variety of books,
        and at the top is his family arms. The inscription\r\n  is a very elegant
        one, and intimates whatsoever fame the school of\r\n  Westminster boasts,
        and whatever advantages mankind shall reap from\r\n  thence in future times,
        are all principally owing to the wise\r\n  institutions of this gentleman,
        who was born at Lutton in\r\n  Lincolnshire, Sept. 22, 1606, and after being
        made Master of\r\n  Westminster college was elected Prebendary of Westminster,
        and\r\n  Treasurer of Wells. He died April 5, 1695.\r\n\r\n  90. The next
        monument, is that erected to the memory of Robert South,\r\n  D.D. who is
        represented in a recumbent posture in his canonical habit,\r\n  with his arm
        resting on a cushion, and his right hand on a death\u2019s\r\n  head. In his
        left he holds a book with his finger between the leaves,\r\n  as if just closed
        from reading, and over his head is a group of\r\n  cherubs issuing from a
        mantling. This monument is however very badly\r\n  executed, and the statue
        is clumsy and unmeaning. It has a long Latin\r\n  inscription, shewing that
        this celebrated divine was scholar to Dr.\r\n  Busby, and student at Christ
        Church, Oxford; that by the patronage of\r\n  the Lord Clarendon he was made
        Prebendary both of Westminster and\r\n  Christ Church, and afterwards rector
        of Islip, where he rebuilt the\r\n  parsonage house, and founded and endowed
        a school for the education of\r\n  poor children. He died on the 8th of July
        1718, aged eighty-two.\r\n\r\n  _The Monuments in the Cloisters._ The most
        ancient of these are\r\n  towards the east end of the south walk, where lie
        the remains of four\r\n  Abbots marked in the pavement by four stones.\r\n\r\n
        \ The first of these covers the Abbot Vitales, who died in 1082, and was\r\n
        \ formerly covered with brass plates.\r\n\r\n  The second is of grey marble,
        to the memory of Gislebertus Crispinus,\r\n  who died in 1114, and whose effigies
        may still be traced on the stone.\r\n\r\n  Under the third, which is a raised
        stone of Sussex marble, lies the\r\n  Abbot Laurentius, who died in 1176,
        and is said to be the first who\r\n  obtained from Pope Alexander III. the
        privilege of using the mitre,\r\n  ring and globe.\r\n\r\n  The last is of
        black marble, and covers the ashes of Gervasius de\r\n  Blois, who was natural
        son to King Stephen, and died in 1166. This is\r\n  called Long Meg, from
        its extraordinary length, it being eleven feet\r\n  eight inches. All these
        seem to have had their names and dates cut\r\n  afresh.\r\n\r\n  In the east
        walk is a handsome monument erected to the memory of\r\n  Daniel Pulteney,
        Esq; facing those of the above Abbots; the\r\n  inscription on which is much
        admired for the purity of the diction,\r\n  and its propriety and elegance,
        and is as follows:\r\n\r\n                                 Reader,\r\n                          If
        thou art a BRITON,\r\n               Behold this tomb with reverence and regret.\r\n
        \                       Here lieth the remains of\r\n                             DANIEL
        PULTENEY,\r\n                 The kindest relation, the truest friend,\r\n
        \                The warmest patriot, the worthiest man;\r\n                    He
        exercised virtues in this age,\r\n          Sufficient to have distinguished
        him even in the best.\r\n                           Sagacious by nature,\r\n
        \                         Industrious by habit,\r\n                          Inquisitive
        with art,\r\n         He gain\u2019d a compleat knowledge of the state of
        Britain,\r\n                          Foreign and domestic.\r\n            In
        most the backward fruit of tedious experience,\r\n           In him the early
        acquisition of undissipated youth.\r\n                    He served the court
        several years:\r\n              Abroad in the auspicious reign of Queen Anne,\r\n
        \  At home, in the reign of that excellent Prince K. George the First.\r\n
        \                     He served his country always,\r\n                          At
        court independent,\r\n                         In the senate unbiass\u2019d,\r\n
        \                  At every age, and in every station:\r\n                 This
        was the bent of his generous soul,\r\n               This was the business
        of his laborious life.\r\n                      Public men, and public things,\r\n
        \                  He judged by one constant standard,\r\n                     _The
        true interest of Britain_;\r\n                  He made no other distinction
        of party,\r\n                          He abhorred all other:\r\n                Gentle,
        humane, disinterested, beneficent,\r\n                He created no enemies
        on his own account:\r\n                      Firm, determined, inflexible,\r\n
        \        He feared none he could create in the cause of Britain.\r\n                                 Reader,\r\n
        \           In this misfortune of thy country, lament thy own:\r\n                                 For

        a public calamity.\r\n\r\n  Almost at the end of the north east walk is a
        monument against the\r\n  Abbey wall to the memory of the Rev. Mr. William
        Laurence, the\r\n  inscription on which is remarkable for its quaintness,
        and is as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n            With diligence and trust exemplary,\r\n
        \           Did William Laurence serve a Prebendary;\r\n            And for

        Dec. 28. 1621. \xC6tat. 29.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _S. Wale delin._ _E.
        Rooker sc._ _Henry the Seventh\u2019s\r\n  Chapel._]\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Henry the
        Seventh\u2019s Chapel._ As this is a separate building from\r\n  Westminster
        Abbey, we did not think proper to confound it with the\r\n  other chapels;
        and as it is joined to the Abbey, we did not chuse to\r\n  render it so distinct
        an article as it would have been, had we given\r\n  it the place it would
        have demanded in the order of the alphabet. It\r\n  is to be examined at the
        same time with that edifice, and we have\r\n  followed the example of the
        architect in uniting them.\r\n\r\n  This chapel, which was founded by Henry
        VII. in the year 1502, and the\r\n  succeeding years, is styled by Leland
        the wonder of the world. It is\r\n  situated to the east of the Abbey, to
        which it is so neatly joined,\r\n  that on a superficial view it appears to
        be one and the same building.\r\n  It is supported by fourteen Gothic buttresses,
        all beautifully\r\n  ornamented, and projecting from the building in different
        angles, and\r\n  is enlightened by a double range of windows that throw the
        light into\r\n  such a happy disposition as at once to please the eye, and
        afford a\r\n  kind of solemn gloom. These buttresses extend up to the roof,
        and are\r\n  made to strengthen it by their being crowned with Gothic arches.
        In\r\n  these buttresses are niches, in which formerly stood a number of\r\n
        \ statues; but these being greatly decayed, have been long taken down.\r\n\r\n
        \ This chapel is one of the most expensive remains of the ancient\r\n  English
        taste and magnificence; there is no looking upon it without\r\n  admiration:
        yet, perhaps, its beauty consists much more eminently in\r\n  the workmanship
        than the contrivance. The plate shews the outside,\r\n  where it joins to
        the Abbey, and gives some idea of the fine taste of\r\n  Gothic architecture
        in that age, which seems to have been its\r\n  meridian; but it soon fell
        into the bad taste practised in the time of\r\n  Queen Elizabeth, as may be
        seen in the tomb of this Queen and her\r\n  predecessor in the side aisles
        of this chapel.\r\n\r\n  This may be sufficient for the outside of this edifice,
        the entrance\r\n  to which is from the east end of the Abbey, by a flight
        of steps of\r\n  black marble, under a very noble arch, that leads to the
        gates opening\r\n  to the body or nave of the chapel: for, like a cathedral
        it is divided\r\n  into a nave and side isles, to which you may enter by a
        door on each\r\n  hand. The gates at the entrance of the nave are of brass
        curiously\r\n  wrought in the manner of frame work, and have in every other
        open\r\n  pannel a rose and portcullis alternately.\r\n\r\n  Being entered,
        the eye is naturally directed to the lofty ceiling, in\r\n  the most admirable
        manner wrought with such an astonishing variety of\r\n  figures as is impossible
        to be described. The stalls on each side are\r\n  of oak, with Gothic canopies,
        most beautifully carved, as are also the\r\n  seats; and the pavement is of
        black and white marble, laid at the\r\n  charge of Dr. Killigrew, once Prebendary
        of this Abbey. The east view\r\n  from the entrance presents you with the
        brass chapel and tomb of the\r\n  founder, which will be hereafter described,
        and round it where the\r\n  east end forms a semicircle, are the chapels of
        the Dukes of\r\n  Buckingham and Richmond. At that end the side isles open
        to the nave.\r\n  It must not be omitted, that the walls both of the nave
        and the side\r\n  isles are adorned with the most curious imagery imaginable,
        and\r\n  contain an hundred and twenty statues of patriarchs, saints, martyrs\r\n
        \ and confessors, under which are angels supporting imperial crowns,\r\n  besides
        innumerable small ones, all of them esteemed so curious, that\r\n  the best
        masters are said to have travelled from abroad to copy them.\r\n  The roof
        of the side isles is flattish, and supported on arches\r\n  between the nave
        and side isles turning upon twelve stately Gothic\r\n  pillars, curiously
        adorned with figures, fruitage and foliage. The\r\n  windows, besides a spacious
        one at the east end, are thirteen on each\r\n  side above and as many below,
        and were formerly painted, having in\r\n  each pane a white rose, the badge
        of the house of Lancaster, a B the\r\n  initial letter of the founder\u2019s
        name, or portcullises crowned, the\r\n  badge of the Beaufort\u2019s family,
        of which there are some now remaining.\r\n\r\n  This chapel was originally
        designed as a sepulchre appropriated solely\r\n  to the use of those of royal
        blood; and so far has the will of the\r\n  founder been observed, that none
        have been yet interred there, but\r\n  those of high quality, whose descent
        may generally be traced from some\r\n  of our ancient Kings: I shall therefore
        mention each of these tombs,\r\n  beginning with that which is the most ancient,
        as well as the most\r\n  astonishing.\r\n\r\n  It has been already observed,
        that in the middle of the east end of\r\n  the nave is situated the magnificent
        tomb of Henry VII. this is\r\n  enclosed with a screen of cast brass, most
        admirably designed, and\r\n  executed; this screen is nineteen feet in length,
        eleven in breadth,\r\n  and the same in height. It is ornamented with statues,
        of which those\r\n  only of St. James, St. Bartholomew, St. George, and St.
        Edward, are\r\n  now remaining; and also adorned with other devices alluding
        to King\r\n  Henry the Seventh\u2019s family; as portcullises, signifying
        his relation\r\n  to the Beaufort\u2019s by his mother\u2019s side; roses
        twisted and crowned, in\r\n  memory of the union of the two houses of Lancaster
        and York, by his\r\n  marriage; and at each end a crown in a bush, alluding
        to the crown of\r\n  Richard III. found in a hawthorn bush, near Bosworth
        field, where the\r\n  famous battle was fought in which Richard lost his life.
        Within the\r\n  rails are the effigies of the royal pair, in their robes of
        state, on\r\n  a tomb of black marble, the head whereof is supported by a
        red dragon\r\n  the ensign of Cadwalladar, from whom King Henry VII. was fond
        of\r\n  tracing his descent, and the foot by an angel.\r\n\r\n  At the head
        of this tomb lie the remains of Edward VI. grandson to\r\n  Henry VII. who
        died in the sixteenth year of his age, and the seventh\r\n  of his reign.
        A fine monument was erected to his memory by Queen Mary,\r\n  his sister and
        successor; it was adorned with curious sculpture\r\n  representing the passion
        and resurrection of our Saviour; with two\r\n  angels on the top kneeling;
        and the whole elegantly finished; but it\r\n  was afterwards demolished as
        a relict of Popish superstition.\r\n\r\n  On one side of Henry the Seventh\u2019s
        tomb in a small chapel, in which is\r\n  the monument of Lewis Stuart Duke
        of Richmond, and Frances his wife;\r\n  whose statues in cast brass are represented
        lying on a marble table\r\n  under a canopy of brass curiously wrought, and
        supported by the\r\n  figures of Faith, Hope, Charity, and Prudence; and on
        the top is a\r\n  figure of Fame taking her flight, and resting only on her
        toe.\r\n\r\n  On the north side of Henry the Seventh\u2019s tomb is a monument
        decorated\r\n  with several emblematical figures in brass gilt; the principal
        is\r\n  Neptune in a pensive posture with his trident reversed, and Mars with\r\n
        \ his head crushed; these support the tomb on which lie the effigies of\r\n
        \ George Villars Duke of Buckingham, the great favourite of King James\r\n
        \ I. and King Charles I. who fell a sacrifice to the national resentment\r\n
        \ by the hand of Felton. His Grace married Catharine, daughter to the\r\n
        \ Earl of Rutland, who erected this monument to his memory, and lies in\r\n
        \ effigy on the same tomb by his side. The Latin inscription, after\r\n  recounting
        his noble qualities, and high titles, alludes to the story\r\n  of his death.\r\n\r\n
        \ Of a later date, and superior in point of design and workmanship, is a\r\n
        \ noble monument erected to the memory of John Sheffield Duke of\r\n  Buckingham,
        where his Grace\u2019s statue in a Roman habit, is laid in a\r\n  half raised
        posture on an altar of fine marble: his Duchess is\r\n  represented standing
        at his feet weeping. On each side are military\r\n  trophies; and over all
        an admirable figure of Time holding several\r\n  medallions representing the
        heads of their Graces children. This\r\n  monument is very justly admired.
        It has been observed, that the Duke\r\n  himself appears the principal figure
        in the group, and though he lies\r\n  in a recumbent posture, and his Lady
        is in the most beautiful manner\r\n  placed at his feet, yet her figure is
        so characterized, as to be only\r\n  a guide to his, and both reflect back
        a beauty on each other. The\r\n  decorations are allowed to be extremely picturesque
        and elegant; the\r\n  trophies at his head, the figure of Time above, with
        the medallions of\r\n  his children, fill up all the spaces with such propriety,
        that little\r\n  could be added, and nothing appears superfluous. The inscription
        sets\r\n  forth the Duke of Buckingham\u2019s posts, and his qualifications
        as a good\r\n  poet, and a fine writer; and over his statue is inscribed in
        Latin\r\n  sentences to the following purpose:\r\n\r\n             I lived
        doubtful, not dissolute.\r\n             I die unresolved, not unresigned.\r\n
        \            Ignorance and error are incident to human nature.\r\n             I
        trust in an Almighty and All-good God.\r\n             Thou King of Kings
        have mercy upon me.\r\n\r\n  And underneath:\r\n\r\n                For my
        King often, for my Country always.\r\n\r\n      His Grace died in the 57th
        year of his age, Feb. 24, 1720,\r\n      leaving the publication of his works
        to the care of Mr. Pope.\r\n      He had three wives; the first, Ursula, Countess
        of Coventry;\r\n      the second, Catharine, Countess of Gainsborough; the
        third,\r\n      Catharine, Countess of Anglesey.\r\n\r\n  In this isle there
        is a lofty pyramid supported by two griffins of\r\n  gilt brass, on a pedestal
        of the most curious marble, erected to the\r\n  memory of Charles Montague,
        Marquis of Halifax, son to George Montague\r\n  of Horton. He was placed at
        the head of the treasury in the reign of\r\n  King Charles I. and undertaking
        the reformation of the coin, which was\r\n  then most infamously clipped,
        he restored it to its proper value. For\r\n  this, and other public services,
        he was first created Baron, and then\r\n  Marquis of Halifax.\r\n\r\n  Against
        the east wall at the end of the north isle is a monument in\r\n  the form
        of a beautiful altar, raised by King Charles II. to the\r\n  memory of Edward
        V. and his brother Richard, on which is an\r\n  inscription in Latin, to the
        following purport:\r\n\r\n      Here lie the reliques of Edward V. King of
        England, and\r\n      Richard Duke of York, who, being confined in the Tower,
        and\r\n      there stifled with pillows, were privately and meanly buried,\r\n
        \     by order of their perfidious uncle Richard the Usurper. Their\r\n      bones,
        long enquired after and wished for, after lying two\r\n      hundred and one
        years in the rubbish of the stairs, lately\r\n      leading to the chapel
        of the White Tower, were on the 17th of\r\n      July 1674, by undoubted proofs
        discovered; being buried deep\r\n      in that place. Charles II. pitying
        their unhappy fate, ordered\r\n      these unfortunate Princes to be laid
        amongst the reliques of\r\n      their predecessors, in the year 1678, and
        the 20th of his\r\n      reign.\r\n\r\n  At the east end of the same isle
        is a vault in which are deposited the\r\n  bodies of King James I. and Anne
        his Queen, daughter to Frederic II.\r\n  King of Denmark.\r\n\r\n  Over this
        vault is a small tomb adorned with the figure of a child,\r\n  erected to
        the memory of Mary the third daughter of James I. who was\r\n  born at Greenwich
        in 1605, and died at two years old.\r\n\r\n  There is also another monument
        on which is the representation of a\r\n  child in a cradle, erected to the
        memory of Sophia, the fourth\r\n  daughter of the same King, who was born
        at Greenwich in 1606, and died\r\n  three days after.\r\n\r\n  In the same
        isle is a lofty monument erected to the memory of Queen\r\n  Elizabeth by
        King James I. her successor. The inscription represents\r\n  her character,
        high descent, and the memorable acts of her glorious\r\n  reign, \u201CThat
        she was the mother of her country, and the patroness of\r\n  religion and
        learning; was herself skilled in many languages, adorned\r\n  with every excellence
        of mind and person, and endowed with princely\r\n  virtues beyond her sex:
        that in her reign religion was refined to its\r\n  original purity; peace
        was established; money restored to its just\r\n  value; domestic insurrections
        quelled; France delivered from intestine\r\n  troubles; the Netherlands supported;
        the Spanish Armada defeated;\r\n  Ireland, almost lost by the secret contrivances
        of Spain, recovered;\r\n  the revenues of both universities improved by a
        law of provisions;\r\n  and, in short, all England enriched. That she was
        a most prudent\r\n  Governess, forty-five years a virtuous and triumphant
        Queen; truly\r\n  religious, and blest in all her great affairs; and that
        after a calm\r\n  and resigned death in the 70th year of her age, she left
        her mortal\r\n  part to be deposited in this church, which she established
        upon a new\r\n  footing, till by the word of Christ she is called to immortality.\u201D
        She\r\n  died March 24, 1602.\r\n\r\n  In the south isle is a lofty and pompous
        tomb erected to the memory of\r\n  Mary Queen of Scots, the mother of King
        James I. who flying into\r\n  England from her rebellious subjects, was taken
        prisoner, tried and\r\n  condemned for conspiring the death of Queen Elizabeth,
        and on the 8th\r\n  of February 1587, beheaded on a scaffold erected in the
        hall of\r\n  Fotheringhay Castle, in Northamptonshire. She was afterwards
        pompously\r\n  interred by order of Queen Elizabeth, in the cathedral church
        of\r\n  Peterborough; but upon the accession of her son to the throne of\r\n
        \ England, he ordered her remains to be removed from thence, and placed\r\n
        \ near this monument.\r\n\r\n  Near the last monument is a tomb enclosed with
        iron rails, on which\r\n  lies a Lady also finely robed, the effigies of Margaret
        Douglas,\r\n  daughter of Margaret Queen of Scots by the Earl of Angus. Her
        son the\r\n  Lord Darnely, father to King James I. is represented foremost
        on the\r\n  tomb kneeling, with the crown over his head, and there are seven
        other\r\n  of her children represented round the tomb. This great Lady, though\r\n
        \ she herself never sat on the throne, had, according to the English\r\n  inscription,
        King Edward IV. to her great grandfather; Henry VII. to\r\n  her grandfather;
        Henry VIII. to her uncle; Edward VI. to her cousin\r\n  german; James V. of
        Scotland to her brother; Henry I. of Scotland to\r\n  her son; James VI. to
        her brother. Having to her great grandmother and\r\n  grandmother two Queens,
        both named Elizabeth; to her mother, Margaret\r\n  Queen of Scots; to her
        aunt, Mary the French Queen; to her cousins\r\n  german, Mary and Elizabeth
        Queens of England; and to her niece and\r\n  daughter-in-law, Mary Queen of
        Scots. This great Lady died March 10,\r\n  1577.\r\n\r\n  In the south side
        is likewise the monument of Margaret Countess of\r\n  Richmond, mother to
        Henry VII. by her first husband Henry Tudor. She\r\n  was afterwards married
        to Humphry Stafford, a younger son to Humphry\r\n  Duke of Buckingham, and
        at last to Thomas Lord Stanley, Earl of Derby;\r\n  but by the two last had
        no children. The inscription mentions the\r\n  charities of this humane and
        generous Princess, particularly her\r\n  founding two colleges at Oxford,
        Christ Church and St. John\u2019s; and a\r\n  grammar school at Winbourne.
        She died in July 1509, in the reign of\r\n  her grandson Henry VIII.\r\n\r\n
        \ At the east end of this isle is the royal vault of King Charles II.,\r\n
        \ King William III., Queen Mary his Consort, Queen Anne, and Prince\r\n  George.\r\n\r\n
        \ Over these royal Personages are their effigies (except that of Prince\r\n
        \ George) in wainscot presses; they are of wax work resembling life, and\r\n
        \ dressed in their coronation robes.\r\n\r\n  Another wainscot press is placed
        at the corner of the great east\r\n  window, in which is the effigy of the
        Lady Mary Duchess of Richmond,\r\n  daughter to James Duke of Richmond and
        Lenox, dressed in the very\r\n  robes her Grace wore at the coronation of
        Queen Anne.\r\n\r\n  On leaving this isle you will be shewn in another wainscot
        press the\r\n  effigies of General Monk, who had a great share in the restoration
        of\r\n  King Charles II. to the throne of England, and was interred in a vault\r\n
        \ appropriated to him and his family. He is represented in armour, and\r\n
        \ his ducal cap is generally made use of by those who shew this chapel,\r\n
        \ to receive the bounty of those who visit it; these persons having no\r\n
        \ share of the money paid for seeing it.\r\n\r\n  Thus have we given a description
        of every thing remarkable in the\r\n  Abbey, and that venerable pile adjoining
        to it, called Henry the\r\n  Seventh\u2019s chapel; we have mentioned and
        described the monuments in\r\n  both that are worthy of notice, and we shall
        conclude this article\r\n  with the following reflections, extracted from
        an ingenious writer, on\r\n  this subject.\r\n\r\n      \u201CHowever amiable
        fame may be to the living, \u2019tis certain no\r\n      advantage to the
        dead, whatever dangers they have dared,\r\n      whatever toils they have
        undergone, whatever difficulties they\r\n      have surmounted; the grave
        is deaf to the voice of applause,\r\n      and the dust of the noble and vulgar
        sleep in the same\r\n      obscurity together. \u2019Tis possible the conscious
        spirit may\r\n      have an idea of the honour that is paid to his ashes;
        but \u2019tis\r\n      much more probable, that the prospect of this imaginary
        glory,\r\n      while he lived among us, was all the pleasure it ever could\r\n
        \     afford him. I make this observation, because most monuments\r\n      are
        said to be erected as an honour to the dead, and the\r\n      living are supposed
        to be the least concerned in them: but one\r\n      man\u2019s fame is made
        the foundation of another\u2019s, in the same\r\n      manner with the gentleman\u2019s,
        who ordered this sentence to be\r\n      made his epitaph; HERE LIES SIR PHILIP
        SIDNEY\u2019S FRIEND. Some\r\n      there are that mention only the names
        of the persons whose\r\n      dust they cover, and preserve a noble silence
        with regard to\r\n      the hand that raised them; but even here, the dead
        can receive\r\n      no benefit from such disinterested affection; but the
        living\r\n      may profit much by so noble an example. Another thing that\r\n
        \     displeases me is the manner of the inscriptions, which\r\n      frequently
        mistake the very design of engraving them, and as\r\n      frequently give
        the lie to themselves. To pore one\u2019s self\r\n      blind in guessing
        out _\xC6tern\xE6 Memori\xE6 Sacrum_, is a jest, that\r\n      would make
        Heraclitus laugh; and yet most of them begin in\r\n      that pompous taste,
        without the least reflection that brass\r\n      and marble can\u2019t preserve
        them from the tooth of Time; and if\r\n      men\u2019s actions have not guarded
        their reputations, the proudest\r\n      monument would flatter in vain. Sepulchral
        monuments should be\r\n      always considered as the last public tribute
        paid to virtue;\r\n      as a proof of our regard for noble characters, and
        most\r\n      particularly as an excitement to others to emulate the great\r\n
        \     example.\r\n\r\n      \u201CIt is certain there is not a nobler amusement,
        than a walk\r\n      in Westminster Abbey, among the tombs of heroes, patriots,\r\n
        \     poets, and philosophers; you are surrounded with the shades\r\n      of
        your great forefathers; you feel the influence of their\r\n      venerable
        society, and grow fond of fame and virtue in the\r\n      contemplation: \u2019tis
        the finest school of morality, and the\r\n      most beautiful flatterer of
        imagination in nature. I appeal\r\n      to any man\u2019s mind that has any
        taste for what is sublime and\r\n      noble, for a witness to the pleasure
        he experiences on this\r\n      occasion; and I dare believe he will acknowledge,
        that there\r\n      is no entertainment so various, or so instructive. For
        my\r\n      own part, I have spent many an hour of pleasing melancholy\r\n
        \     in its venerable walks; and have been more delighted with\r\n      the
        solemn conversation of the dead, than the most sprightly\r\n      sallies
        of the living. I have examined the characters that\r\n      were inscribed
        before me, and distinguished every particular\r\n      virtue. The monuments
        of real fame, I have viewed with real\r\n      respect; but the piles that
        wanted a character to excuse\r\n      them, I considered as the monuments
        of folly. I have\r\n      wandered with pleasure into the most gloomy recesses
        of this\r\n      last resort of grandeur, to contemplate human life, and\r\n
        \     trace mankind thro\u2019 all the wilderness of their frailties\r\n      and
        misfortunes, from their cradles to their grave. I have\r\n      reflected
        on the shortness of our duration here, and that I\r\n      was but one of
        the millions who had been employed in the\r\n      same manner, in ruminating
        on the trophies of mortality\r\n      before me; that I must moulder to dust
        in the same manner,\r\n      and quit the scene to a new generation, without
        leaving the\r\n      shadow of my existence behind me; that this huge fabric,\r\n
        \     this sacred repository of fame and grandeur, would only be\r\n      the
        stage for the same performances; would receive new\r\n      accessions of
        noble dust; would be adorned with other\r\n      sepulchres of cost and magnificence;
        would be crouded with\r\n      successive admirers; and at last, by the unavoidable
        decays\r\n      of time, bury the whole collection of antiquities in general\r\n
        \     obscurity, and be the monument of its own ruin.\u201D\r\n\r\nABBOTS
        LANGLEY, a village in Hertfordshire, situated to the east of\r\n  Kings Langley,
        and three or four miles to the S. W. of St. Alban\u2019s, to\r\n  whose abbey
        it once belonged. It is famous for being the birth place\r\n  of Nicholas
        Breakspeare, who was made Pope by the title of Adrian IV.\r\n  and had his
        stirrup held by the Emperor Frederic while he dismounted:\r\n  but notwithstanding
        his pride, it is a still more indelible stain to\r\n  his memory, that when
        Sovereign Pontiff, he suffer\u2019d his mother to be\r\n  maintained by the
        alms of the church of Canterbury. This place gives\r\n  the title of Baron

        many poor as came. This charity was begun in the days of Popery,\r\n  in order,

        _court_. This court, which is held in Doctors Commons, was\r\n  formerly under
        the direction of the Lord High Admiral, as it is now\r\n  under the Lords
        of the Admiralty, who here take cognisance of all\r\n  causes relating to
        merchants and mariners. The proceedings are in the\r\n  Civil Law. The plaintiff
        gives security to prosecute, and if cast, to\r\n  pay what shall be adjudged,
        and likewise to stand to all his proctor\r\n  shall transact in his name.
        But in criminal cases, as the trial of\r\n  pirates, and crimes committed
        at sea, the process, by a special\r\n  commission, is by a judge, jury and
        witnesses, a Judge of the Common\r\n  Law assisting: on which occasion the
        court is commonly held at the\r\n  Session-house in the Old Bailey. The officers
        of this court are the\r\n  Judge of the Admiralty, who must be a Civilian,
        an Advocate and\r\n  Proctor, a Register, and a Marshal, who carries a silver
        oar before\r\n  the Judge.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _S. Wale delin._ _J.

        COMPANY. The English first sent ships to Africa on account of\r\n  commerce
        about the year 1553, from which time the trade to that\r\n  country was carried
        on by private hands till 1588, when Queen\r\n  Elizabeth, by her letters patent,
        erected a company, for the more\r\n  effectual promoting of that trade, which
        then was only for gold,\r\n  elephants teeth, and Guinea pepper; for the use
        of negroes was not yet\r\n  introduced into America.\r\n\r\n  This company
        was greatly encouraged during the reigns of James I. and\r\n  Charles I. but
        the Dutch taking several forts on the coast of Africa\r\n  from the Portuguese,
        committed great depredations on the English, upon\r\n  which Charles II. the
        better to enable his subjects to carry on that\r\n  trade, incorporated a
        body of merchants, in the year 1662, by the\r\n  title of _The Company of
        Royal Adventurers of England to Africa_: but\r\n  the subscriptions for carrying
        on this precarious commerce not\r\n  answering the expectation of the incorporated
        merchants, they were\r\n  soon involved in debt, and reduced to such difficulties
        as rendered\r\n  them unable to continue their trade to advantage; wherefore
        they\r\n  agreed for a certain sum, to surrender their charter to the crown,
        and\r\n  to assign all their estates and effects both at home and abroad to\r\n
        \ certain merchants, who intended to erect a new company, for the more\r\n
        \ effectual carrying on a trade to Africa: these merchants the King\r\n  incorporated
        in the year 1672, and these were the Royal African\r\n  company, who had a
        power to trade from the port of Sallee, to the Cape\r\n  of Good Hope, exclusive
        of all the King\u2019s other subjects, during the\r\n  term of a thousand
        years.\r\n\r\n  By virtue of this royal grant, the company made a considerable\r\n
        \ progress in erecting forts, and settling factors: but their trade\r\n  being
        laid open by parliament in the year 1697, they were rendered\r\n  unable to
        support their forts, it was therefore enacted, that all\r\n  private traders
        to Africa should pay ten _per cent._ to the company\r\n  for that purpose.\r\n\r\n
        \ This duty did not however answer the end for which it was granted, and\r\n
        \ the company was obliged to apply to parliament in the year 1730 for\r\n
        \ relief, when they obtained a certain sum for that purpose, and it was\r\n
        \ enacted that all his Majesty\u2019s subjects treading to and from Africa,\r\n
        \ between Cape Blanco and the Cape of Good Hope, should hereafter be\r\n  deemed
        a body corporate, and that all the countries, islands, rivers\r\n  and places,
        together with the forts, should be in the possession of\r\n  this new company;
        the members of which should not trade to or from\r\n  Africa in their joint
        capacity, have any joint or transferable stock,\r\n  or borrow money on their
        common seal. That the persons trading or\r\n  intending to trade to Africa,
        should pay to the Chamberlain of London,\r\n  the Clerk of the Merchants-hall
        in Bristol, or the Town Clerk of\r\n  Liverpool, 40_s._ each for the freedom
        of the new company. That the\r\n  management of the affairs of this new company,
        should be under the\r\n  direction of a committee of nine persons, to be chosen
        annually, three\r\n  out of the members in the city of London, three out of
        those of\r\n  Bristol, and three out of those of Liverpool. That this committee\r\n
        \ should have power to make orders for the government and improvement of\r\n
        \ the forts and factories; to appoint governors, and other officers\r\n  civil
        and military; to receive annually the sum of 40_s._ and to take\r\n  a list
        of the names of all the persons making payment.\r\n\r\n  It is also enacted,
        that the committee shall once a year give an\r\n  account of all their transactions
        to the Commissioners for trade and\r\n  plantations, and likewise lay before
        the Cursitor Baron of the\r\n  Exchequer, an account, upon oath, of all the
        money they have received\r\n  within the preceding year, and the application
        thereof; and the Lords\r\n  of the Admiralty are to give instructions to the

        \ On the east side stood the shrine of St. Alban, where the following\r\n
        \ short inscription is still to be seen;\r\n\r\n      S. ALBANUS VEROLAMENSIS,
        ANGLORUM PROTOMARTYR, 17 Junii 293.\r\n\r\n  In the south isle near the above
        shrine is the monument of Humphry,\r\n  brother to King Henry V. commonly
        distinguished by the title of the\r\n  Good Duke of Gloucester. It is adorned
        with a ducal coronet, and the\r\n  arms of France and England quartered. In
        niches on one side are\r\n  seventeen Kings; but in the niches on the other
        side there are no\r\n  statues remaining. The inscription, which alludes to
        the pretended\r\n  miraculous cure of a blind man detected by the Duke, is
        as follows:\r\n\r\n                      Pi\xE6 Memori\xE6 V. Opt. Sacrum.\r\n

        scarce allowed his bones this spot of land:\r\n            Yet spite of envy
        shall his glory stand.\r\n\r\n  About 40 years ago in digging a grave, a pair
        of stairs were\r\n  discovered that lead down into a vault where his leaden
        coffin was\r\n  found, in which his body was preserved entire, by a kind of
        pickle in\r\n  which it lay, only the flesh was wasted from the legs, the
        pickle at\r\n  that end being dried up. Many curious medals and coins are
        to be seen\r\n  in the church, that have been dug out of the ruins of Old
        Verulam that\r\n  stood on the other side of the river Ver, or Moore, which
        runs south\r\n  west of the town.\r\n\r\n  Near St. Alban\u2019s is a fort,
        at a place called by the common people the\r\n  Oyster Hills, which is supposed
        to have been the camp of Ostorius, the\r\n  Roman Propr\xE6tor. This town
        is the largest in the county, and besides\r\n  the four churches, has several
        meeting-houses, two charity schools,\r\n  and three fairs, and has on Saturday
        one of the best markets for wheat\r\n  in England. It gives the title of Duke
        to the noble family of\r\n  Beauclerc. The great John Duke of Marlborough
        erected a seat here,\r\n  called Holloway-house, and several neat alms-houses
        have been built\r\n  here by him and his Duchess.\r\n\r\n_St._ ALBAN\u2019S,
        _Wood street_, on the north side of London, and the east\r\n  side of Wood
        street, Cheapside, is dedicated to St. Alban, the British\r\n  Proto-Martyr,
        who suffered under the persecution of Dioclesian. The\r\n  first church in
        this place was erected in the year 930, and dedicated\r\n  to the same Saint.
        After various repairs, the old church was pulled\r\n  down in 1634, and another
        erected, which was destroyed by the fire of\r\n  London thirty-two years after,
        when the present edifice was built from\r\n  the same model as the former.
        It is entirely in the Gothic stile, and\r\n  consists of a spacious body,
        and a handsome tower with pinacles.\r\n\r\n  This church is a rectory in the
        patronage of Eton College, and the\r\n  parish of St. Olave, Silver street,
        is united to it. The Rector,\r\n  besides other advantages, receives 170_l._
        in lieu of tithes.\r\n\r\n  Munday in his edition of Stow mentions several
        uncommon epitaphs in\r\n  this church, from which we have only selected the
        following:\r\n\r\n                 Hic jacet Tom Shorthose,\r\n                   Sine

        Mead, Esq; in Albemarle street, is a book\r\n  bought out of the collection
        of the famous Cardinal Maximi at Rome; it\r\n  contain 148 accurate and elegant
        paintings in water colours, done from\r\n  ancient pictures found on the walls,
        ceilings and floors of the baths\r\n  of Titus, and various other buildings
        in Rome, some of which have been\r\n  engraved by Bartoli in his _Sepolchri
        di Nassoni_, and in other books:\r\n  but many of them are to be seen no where
        else, neither engraved, nor\r\n  on the walls from whence they were first
        copied, where they are much\r\n  defaced by the weather, the smoke of torches,
        and other accidents.\r\n\r\n  Of these ancient paintings on wall, Mr. Mead
        has also a very elegant\r\n  little specimen representing Augustus restoring
        a crown to a conquered\r\n  Prince in the presence of several of his courtiers,
        among which the\r\n  faces of Mec\xE6nas and Horace may be distinguished.\u2014This

        inscription, being eight lines of Hexameter and\r\n  Pentameter verses on
        a marble brought from Asia, which had been a\r\n  pedestal to a statue of
        Jupiter Urius. This has been engraved and\r\n  explained by the learned Mr.

        the\r\n  present hall was built at the end of King street, about the year
        1420.\r\n  The old hall must have been very ancient, as this street had the
        name\r\n  of Aldermanbury so early as before the year 1189; and Mr. Maitland\r\n
        \ supposes that Edward the Confessor, who began his reign in 1042, had a\r\n

        and each has his separate\r\n  ward, to the government of which he is more
        immediately to attend.\r\n  Those who have served the office of Lord Mayor,
        are said to be above\r\n  the chair, and with three of the eldest that are
        next it, are justices\r\n  of the peace by charter. All the Aldermen keep
        their wardmote for\r\n  chusing ward officers, and settling the affairs of
        the ward; for\r\n  redressing grievances, and presenting all defaults found
        in the ward.\r\n  In the management of these affairs, every Alderman has his
        deputy,\r\n  chosen out of the common council, and in some of the wards, that
        are\r\n  very large, the Alderman has two deputies.\r\n\r\nALDERSGATE, which
        is situated 1265 feet south west of Cripplegate, is,\r\n  in Stow\u2019s opinion,
        one of the original gates of the city; but this is\r\n  disputed by Maitland,
        who observes, that the epithet of Alder does not\r\n  necessarily imply its
        antiquity, as some derive the name of the gate\r\n  from Aldrich, a Saxon;
        others from the seniors or old men by whom it\r\n  was built; and others from
        the great number of alder trees, which grew\r\n  in that neighbourhood; whence
        he imagines that either of these\r\n  opinions is more probable, than that
        this name was conferred upon it\r\n  on account of its age, particularly as
        it is no where found to be\r\n  mentioned before the conquest.\r\n\r\n  The
        present gate was built in the year 1616, and being much damaged by\r\n  the
        fire of London, was repaired in 1670. In a large square over the\r\n  arch
        is King James I. on horseback, in the same posture as when he\r\n  made his
        entry through this gate, on his coming to take possession of\r\n  the crown.
        The arms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, are quartered\r\n  above his head.
        In a nich on the east side is the prophet Jeremiah,\r\n  with the words of
        the 25th verse of the 17th chapter of his book; and\r\n  in a nich on the
        west side stands the prophet Samuel, with the first\r\n  verse of the 12th
        chap. of 1 Sam. On the south side is King James I.\r\n  in his royal robes,
        sitting in a chair of state, done in relief. By\r\n  the sides of the gate
        there are two posterns for the convenience of\r\n  foot passengers: and the
        apartments above are appropriated to the use\r\n  of the common crier of the
        city.\r\n\r\n  A late author observes, that this gate is so heavy and Gothic
        a\r\n  structure, that it hardly deserves notice, unless for the sake of the\r\n
        \ bass relief of King James, which, though in an aukward and inelegant\r\n
        \ taste, is a very tolerable piece of workmanship, and may challenge\r\n  some
        applause.\r\n\r\nALDERSGATE _bars_, in Goswell street, a little beyond the
        north end of\r\n  Aldersgate street, where the liberties of the city end on
        that side.\r\n\r\nALDERSGATE _street_, extends from the gate to the corner
        of Barbican.\r\n\r\nALDERSGATE WARD, is of considerable extent both within
        and without the\r\n  gate from which it is named, and extends in length from
        Blowbladder\r\n  street to Aldersgate bars, including part of Noble street,
        almost all\r\n  Foster lane, St. Martin\u2019s le Grand, Bull and Mouth street,
        Little\r\n  Britain, and Aldersgate street. The principal buildings are two\r\n
        \ churches, St. Botolph\u2019s and St. Ann\u2019s, Goldsmiths-hall, Cooks-hall,\r\n
        \ Coachmakers-hall, Shaftsbury house, a noble building now used for the\r\n
        \ London lying-in hospital, and London-house. This ward is governed by\r\n
        \ an Alderman, two Deputies, and eight Common Council Men; eight\r\n  constables,
        nine scavengers, nineteen wardmote inquest men and a\r\n  beadle. The jurymen
        returned by the wardmote inquest serve in the\r\n  several courts in Guildhall
        in the month of August.\r\n\r\nALDGATE, was one of the four original gates
        of the city, and that\r\n  through which the Roman vicinal way led to the
        _trajectus_ or ferry at\r\n  Old Ford. Stow says, that it received its name
        from its antiquity,\r\n  which Maitland observes is very improbable, though
        he allows that the\r\n  Saxons might give it the epithet of _Eald_ or _Ald_,
        from the ruinous\r\n  condition in which they found it when they first possessed
        themselves\r\n  of this city. However, the first time it is found mentioned,
        is in a\r\n  charter granted by King Edgar about the year 967.\r\n\r\n  Aldgate
        being very ruinous, was pulled down in the year 1606, and the\r\n  first stone
        of the present edifice was laid the next year; but this\r\n  work was not
        finished till 1609. It is observable that in digging the\r\n  foundation,
        several Roman coins were discovered, two of which Mr. Bond\r\n  the surveyor
        caused to be cut on stone, and placed on each side of the\r\n  east front.
        On the same side was placed in a large square the statue\r\n  of King James
        I. in gilt armour, with a golden lion and a chained\r\n  unicorn couchant
        at his feet. On the top of the gate was a vane\r\n  supported by a gilt sphere,
        on each side of which stood a soldier\r\n  holding a bullet in his hand, on
        the top of the upper battlements. On\r\n  the west side was a figure of Fortune
        gilt, and standing on a globe,\r\n  with a prosperous sail spreading over
        her head; under which was carved\r\n  the King\u2019s arms; some what lower
        on the south side stood Peace with a\r\n  dove perched on her hand, and a
        gilded wreath in the other; and on the\r\n  north side was the emblem of Charity.
        Over the arch of the gate was\r\n  also engraven,\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Senatus
        Populusque_ Londinensis\r\n                               _Fecit_ 1609\r\n

        statues have been removed, and none of these ornaments\r\n  remain, except
        the representation of the two Roman coins, and the\r\n  inscription.\r\n\r\n
        \ The apartments over this gate are appropriated to the use of one of\r\n
        \ the Lord Mayor\u2019s carvers.\r\n\r\nALDGATE _high street_, extends from

        on the east by Portsoken ward; on the south by\r\n  Tower street ward; and
        on the west and north, by the wards of\r\n  Langbourn, Lime street and Bishopsgate.
        It extends from Aldgate to\r\n  Lime street corner in Leadenhall street, and
        takes in all the streets\r\n  and lanes on the one hand to Bevis Mark and
        Shoemaker row, and on the\r\n  other to Ironmongers hall in Fenchurch street;
        to the navy office,\r\n  only a part of which is in this ward, and to the
        end of River street\r\n  Tower hill; including Poor Jury lane, Crutched Friars,
        London street,\r\n  Woodroff lane, _&c._ The principal buildings are these
        four parish\r\n  churches, St. Catharine Cree church, St. Andrew Undershaft,
        St. James\r\n  Duke\u2019s place, and St. Catharine Coleman; three Jews Synagogues,
        and\r\n  the Ironmongers, Fletchers and Bricklayers halls. It is under the\r\n

        \ the Alderman\u2019s deputy, with six constables, nine scavengers, eighteen\r\n

        was not well\r\n  understood in England. The church is of considerable extent,

        \             This happy pair of the celestial choir.\r\n\r\nALLHALLOWS _the
        Great_, situated on the south side of Thames street, was\r\n  anciently denominated
        _Allhallows the More_, and _Allhallows ad F\u0153num_\r\n  in the _Ropery_,
        from its vicinity to a hay-wharf or market, and\r\n  situation among ropemakers.
        The old church with a large cloister on\r\n  the south side, were consumed
        in the general conflagration in 1666,\r\n  and the present edifice arose in
        1683. It was built on Sir Christopher\r\n  Wren\u2019s plan; but in some parts
        the mason has taken inexcusable\r\n  liberties. The church is 87 feet in length,
        60 in breadth, and the\r\n  height to the roof is 33. It is built of stone,
        and there runs thro\u2019\r\n  the whole, an apparent strength and solidity.
        The walls are plain and\r\n  massy, the ornaments are few and simple, and
        the apertures, tho\u2019\r\n  large, in order to enlighten so considerable
        a breadth, are not\r\n  numerous. The tower is plain, square, and divided
        into five stages,\r\n  but terminates absolutely square and plain, without
        spire, turret or\r\n  pinacles. The cornice is supported by scrolls, and over
        these rises a\r\n  balustrade of solid construction, very proper for the rest
        of the\r\n  building. _Maitland, and English Architecture._\r\n\r\n  Among
        the funeral monuments in this church, before its being burnt,\r\n  was one
        in memory of Queen Elizabeth, with the following inscriptions:\r\n\r\n       If
        royal virtues ever crown\u2019d a crown;\r\n         If ever mildness shin\u2019d
        in majesty;\r\n       If ever honour honour\u2019d true renown;\r\n         If
        ever courage dwelt with clemency;\r\n       If ever Princess put all Princes
        down,\r\n         For temperance, prowess, prudence, equity;\r\n       This,
        this was she, that in despight of death\r\n       Lives still admir\u2019d,

        the east end\r\n  of Honey lane market is at present situated; but being destroyed
        by\r\n  the fire of London in 1666, the parish was by act of parliament united\r\n
        \ to the church of St. Mary le Bow.\r\n\r\nALLHALLOWS _the Less_, stood on
        the south side of Thames street, almost\r\n  adjoining to that of Allhallows
        the Great; but having suffered in the\r\n  common calamity in 1666, the parish
        was united to that of Allhallows\r\n  the Great.\r\n\r\nALLHALLOWS _Lombard
        street_, situated in Bell alley, near the north\r\n  corner of Lombard street,
        in Langbourn ward. A church stood here under\r\n  the same patronage, before
        the year 1053; but the present plain,\r\n  well-proportioned building, was
        erected in the room of that destroyed\r\n  by the fire of London. The body
        is enlightened by a single series of\r\n  large windows, and the tower is
        terminated by a plain battlement.\r\n\r\n  This church is a rectory, and one
        of the thirteen peculiars in this\r\n  city belonging to the Archbishop of
        Canterbury. The Rector, besides\r\n  glebes, donations, and casualties, receives

        rectory, in the King\u2019s gift.\r\n\r\nALLHALLOWS _Staining_, situated near
        the north end of Mark lane. It is\r\n  said to obtain the name of Staining,
        from the corruption of the word\r\n  _stoney_, because built at first of stone,
        when the other churches\r\n  dedicated to all the Saints were of wood. It
        escaped the fire in 1666.\r\n  The body is well illuminated with Gothic windows,
        and the square tower\r\n  is crowned with a small turret.\r\n\r\n  This church
        is a curacy, in the gift of the Grocers company. The\r\n  curate receives

        STAINING SCHOOL, was founded in the year 1658, by Mr. William\r\n  Winter,
        who endowed it with the sum of 600_l._ the profits arising\r\n  from which,
        amounting to 26_l._ _per annum_, are employed in\r\n  instructing six boys
        in reading, writing, and accounts, and putting\r\n  them out apprentice, with

        goods of persons\r\n  found guilty of self-murder, and other sums allowed
        by his Majesty to\r\n  be disposed of for that purpose. Besides the sums distributed
        to the\r\n  poor of several parishes, there are many poor pensioners to the

        name from the alms of\r\n  the Abbey being distributed there, and was originally
        a chapel\r\n  dedicated to St. Catharine, and not, as Mr. Stow asserts, to
        St. Anne.\r\n  Near this chapel Abbot Islip erected the first printing-house
        that\r\n  ever was in England in the year 1474; when Mr. William Caxton, a\r\n
        \ citizen and mercer of London, bringing that invaluable art from\r\n  Holland,
        became the first printer in Britain. _Maitland._\r\n\r\nALMONRY SCHOOL, situated

        or AGMONDESHAM, a small but very ancient borough, in\r\n  Buckinghamshire,
        situated in a vale between woody hills, 29 miles from\r\n  London. This town
        does not come within the compass which we have\r\n  prescribed round London,
        but our map of the environs not being a\r\n  circle, the angles of it take
        in some few places at a greater distance\r\n  than 20 miles; and these being
        inserted in our map, we thought we\r\n  could not dispense with taking notice
        of them, as well as of those\r\n  within the prescribed limits. The town consists
        of a long street,\r\n  divided about the middle by a shorter cross street;
        in the\r\n  intersection of which stands the church, said to be the best rectory\r\n
        \ in the county; it being well endowed by Geoffery de Mandeville, Earl\r\n
        \ of Essex, in the reign of King Stephen. There is here a handsome\r\n  market-house,
        built with brick on arched pillars, about 80 years ago,\r\n  by Sir William
        Drake, Knt. It has a free school founded in the reign\r\n  of Queen Elizabeth;
        and here is also a fine seat called Shardelowes,\r\n  the manor of which formerly
        belonged to the noble family of the\r\n  Russels; but about the time of the
        restoration it was sold, with the\r\n  borough, to Sir William Drake, Bart.
        in whose family it still remains.\r\n\r\nAMICABLE SOCIETY, in Serjeants-inn
        Fleet street, was incorporated by a\r\n  charter granted by Queen Anne, in
        the year 1706, for a perpetual\r\n  Assurance-office for the purpose of making
        a provision for their\r\n  wives, children, and other relations, after an
        easy, certain and\r\n  advantageous manner, with power to purchase lands,
        &c. and to have a\r\n  seal, which is a dove standing upon a serpent, and
        above in a scroll\r\n  the motto PRUDENS SIMPLICITAS. The number of persons
        to be\r\n  incorporated was not to exceed 2000. After paying the charges of
        the\r\n  policy, and 10_s._ entrance-money, each person was to pay 6_l._ 4_s._\r\n
        \ _per annum_, which annual payments have since, by the increase of the\r\n
        \ Society\u2019s stock, been reduced to 5_l._ a year, payable quarterly, and\r\n
        \ from these payments the dividends to claimants are to arise.\r\n\r\n  That
        this Society has been greatly beneficial to the public, evidently\r\n  appears
        from a state of their yearly dividends from Lady-day 1710, to\r\n  Lady 1757,
        during which each claim amounted upon an average to 106_l._\r\n  1_s._ 4_d._
        but taking the computation only for these twenty-three\r\n  years last past,
        _viz._ from the year 1734, (when by an order of the\r\n  general court, a
        part of their yearly income was appropriated for\r\n  augmenting their claims
        whenever they should happen to be under\r\n  100_l._) the quantum of such
        claims from the year 1734 to 1757, have\r\n  amounted upon an average to 120_l._
        9_s._ 1_d._ and so considerable\r\n  has been the increase of the dividends
        for these nine years last past,\r\n  that each claim, during that period,
        has been advanced upon an average\r\n  to 142_l._ 6_s._ 5_d._\r\n\r\n  However,
        at a general court held May 12, 1757, an order was made for\r\n  farther augmenting
        the dividends on claims, so as that for the future\r\n  they will not be less
        than 125_l._ each claim, but yet may happen to\r\n  be considerably more,
        which has been the case of several former years.\r\n\r\n  The advantages from
        becoming members of this society are such as\r\n  follow:\r\n\r\n  To clergymen,
        physicians, surgeons, lawyers, tradesmen, and\r\n  particularly persons possessed
        of places or employments for life: to\r\n  such parents, husbands, or wives,
        and other relations, whose income is\r\n  subject to be determined or diminished
        at their respective deaths, who\r\n  by insuring their lives by means of this
        Society, may now in all\r\n  events leave to their families a claim, or right,
        to receive a sum not\r\n  less than 125_l._ for every five pounds annually
        paid in, and very\r\n  probably a larger sum, as appears by the above account.\r\n\r\n
        \ To married persons, more especially where a jointure, pension, or\r\n  annuity
        depends on both or either of their lives, by insuring the life\r\n  of the
        persons intitled to such annuity, pension or jointure.\r\n\r\n  To dependents
        upon any other person intitled to a salary, benefaction,\r\n  or other means
        of subsistence, during the life of such person, whose\r\n  life being insured
        in this society, either by themselves, or by the\r\n  person upon whom they
        are dependent, will intitle them to receive upon\r\n  the death of such person,
        a sum not less than 125_l._ for each number\r\n  so insured.\r\n\r\n  To persons
        wanting to borrow money, who by insuring their lives, are\r\n  enabled to
        give a collateral security for the money borrowed.\r\n\r\n  To creditors intitled
        to demands larger than their debtors are able to\r\n  discharge, such debtors
        may, by a like insurance, secure to their\r\n  creditors their principal sums
        at their deaths.\r\n\r\n  The abovementioned advantages are chiefly with respect
        to perpetual\r\n  insurances for life; but temporary insurers may find no
        less advantage\r\n  from this Society, as may plainly appear from the following
        instance,\r\n  _viz._ _A. B._ has agreed for the purchase of an office or
        employment,\r\n  but wants 300_l._ or 400_l._ to make up the purchase-money:
        he is\r\n  willing to assign a share of the profits or income of his office,
        as a\r\n  security or pledge for the repayment of the principal with interest,\r\n
        \ but cannot obtain a loan of that sum without insuring his life till\r\n
        \ the whole be cleared, which he is enabled to do by the help of this\r\n
        \ Society. For example; He purchases three numbers, on each of which he\r\n
        \ insures his life, and thereby his assigns become intitled to three\r\n  several
        claims at his death; which claims, by the abovementioned\r\n  provision, will
        not be less than 125_l._ each, and may probably amount\r\n  to more: he assigns
        and deposits his policy with the lender: he pays\r\n  to the Society for the
        yearly contributions on the three numbers no\r\n  more than 5_l._ each, which
        is considerably less than 5_l._ _per\r\n  cent._ under which rate no other
        office will insure, and that for one\r\n  year only; at the end of which such
        offices are at liberty to refuse\r\n  any further insurance: whereas in this
        Society the insurance continues\r\n  during the life of the insured, unless
        excluded by the non-payment of\r\n  the quarterly contributions. And every
        insurer, or their\r\n  representatives, at the end of their insurance may
        in a great measure\r\n  (if not entirely) reimburse themselves their purchase-money\r\n
        \ (originally paid by them for their numbers) by disposing of them at a\r\n
        \ market price, which they may do without any farther trouble than\r\n  applying
        to the Society\u2019s office.\r\n\r\n  The regulations of the Society are
        as follow:\r\n\r\n  All persons at the time of their admission are to be between
        the ages\r\n  of twelve and forty-five, and must then appear to be in a good
        state\r\n  of health.\r\n\r\n  Persons living in the country may be admitted
        by certificates and\r\n  affidavit, forms of which may be had at the office.\r\n\r\n
        \ Every claimant is impowered to put in a new life in the room of the\r\n
        \ deceased within twelve calendar months next after the end of the\r\n  current
        year, for which his or her claim shall be allowed as often as\r\n  the same
        shall happen, upon payment of 10_s._ entrance.\r\n\r\n  Any person may have
        two or three several insurances, or numbers, on\r\n  one and the same life,
        whereby such persons will be intitled to a\r\n  claim on each number so insured.\r\n\r\n
        \ The affairs of the corporation are managed by a court of twelve\r\n  directors
        annually chosen within forty days after every 25th of March;\r\n  and the
        majority of the members assembled at a general court, which is\r\n  never
        to consist of less than twenty, are impowered to make laws and\r\n  ordinances
        for the good government of the corporation. The charter\r\n  directs one of
        the members of the Society to be elected their\r\n  Register, who being also
        their receiver and accomptant, is therefore\r\n  required by the by-laws to
        give good security in the sum of 2000_l._\r\n  at least.\r\n\r\n  Five members
        of the Society are annually elected auditors, who are by\r\n  their office
        to inspect every transaction of the Society, to examine\r\n  all vouchers
        for receipts and payments, and upon oath to lay before\r\n  the quarterly
        and annual general courts, the quarterly and annual\r\n  accounts of the Society:
        and on the day before the holding each court\r\n  of directors, the auditors
        are to state and enter in the directors\r\n  minute book a balance of the
        cash of the Society.\r\n\r\n  Attendance is daily given at the Society\u2019s

        \ to so many others; but ten years after being found too ruinous for\r\n  repair,
        was taken down in 1687, and the present structure erected in\r\n  its place,
        except the tower, which was not finished till the year\r\n  1704.\r\n\r\n
        \ This church has a considerable space before it, which is entered by a\r\n
        \ handsome pair of iron gates. It is a neat edifice, with two series of\r\n
        \ windows, and a handsome balustrade round the top. The tower, which\r\n  rises
        square, consists only of two stages, and round the top is a\r\n  balustrade
        with a pinacle at each corner; on the crown of each is\r\n  placed a pine
        apple, from which rises the fanes. On the inside, the\r\n  church is extremely
        neat and well finished.\r\n\r\n  The living is a rectory, said to be worth
        600_l._ a year, in the\r\n  patronage of the Duke of Montague. _Stow, Maitland,

        where the King\u2019s weigh-house now\r\n  stands; but being destroyed by
        the fire of London, and not rebuilt,\r\n  the parish was united to that of
        St. Mary at Hill.\r\n\r\n_St._ ANDREW _Undershaft_, at the corner of St. Mary
        Ax in Leadenhall\r\n  street, and in Aldgate ward. There stood in this place
        a church\r\n  dedicated to the same Saint so early as in 1362, which was pulled
        down\r\n  in the year 1532, and the present structure erected in its room.
        It\r\n  obtained the name of _Undershaft_ from a may-pole, which was anciently\r\n
        \ called a shaft, being annually raised in the street near it on\r\n  May-day,
        and was taller than the steeple.\r\n\r\n  This church is a plain gothic structure,
        with a well enlightened body,\r\n  and a square tower terminated by battlements,
        with pinacles at the\r\n  corners, within which rises a turret that contains
        the bell. It is a\r\n  rectory, in the patronage of the Bishop of London.

        _Wardrobe_, on the east side of Puddledock hill, in Castle\r\n  Baynard ward,
        took its name from a great royal wardrobe erected there\r\n  in the reign
        of King Edward III. There was a church on the same spot\r\n  dedicated to
        St. Andrew in the year 1322: but the present structure\r\n  was not built
        till the year 1670, when it was erected in the place of\r\n  one burnt by
        the fire of London. The body is enlightened by two rows\r\n  of windows, and
        the tower has neither turret, pinacles nor spire.\r\n\r\n  This church is
        a rectory, in the gift of the Crown, and to this parish\r\n  that of St. Ann\u2019s
        Black Friars is annexed. The Rector receives by act\r\n  of parliament 140_l._

        side of St. Ann\u2019s lane, in the\r\n  ward of Aldersgate within, is dedicated
        to St. Ann the mother of the\r\n  Virgin Mary. The old church in this place
        perished in the fire 1666,\r\n  and the present was raised in its place about
        three years after. It is\r\n  a very plain edifice: the body is enlightened
        by a few large windows,\r\n  cased with rustic. The tower, which is very plain,
        is also\r\n  strengthened at the corners with rustic, and from its top rises
        a\r\n  turret and spire.\r\n\r\n  The church is a rectory in the patronage
        of the Bishop of London, and\r\n  the parish of St. John Zachary is annexed
        to it. The Rector receives\r\n  140_l._ _per annum_, in lieu of tithes.\r\n\r\n_St._

        \ but having suffered in the fatal calamity of 1666, and not being\r\n  rebuilt,
        the parish was annexed to that St. Andrew Wardrobe.\r\n\r\n_St._ ANN\u2019S
        _Limehouse_, arose from the great increase of houses and\r\n  inhabitants,
        by which the village of Limehouse, a hamlet of Stepney,\r\n  became joined
        to the metropolis, and it was resolved that here should\r\n  be one of the
        fifty new churches appointed by act of parliament to be\r\n  built within
        the bills of mortality. The foundation was laid in the\r\n  year 1712, and
        the present structure finished in 1729; but the\r\n  inhabitants of this hamlet
        not applying to parliament to have it\r\n  erected into a parish till the
        year 1729, it was not consecrated till\r\n  1730. This hamlet and part of
        that of Ratcliff, having been\r\n  constituted a distinct parish from that
        of Stepney, the sum of\r\n  3500_l._ was given by parliament to be laid out
        in fee simple towards\r\n  the support of the Rector; besides which the church
        wardens were to\r\n  pay him annually the sum of 60_l._ to be raised by burial
        fees.\r\n\r\n  This church is of a very singular construction, the body is
        not one\r\n  plain building, but is continued under separate portions. The
        door\r\n  under the tower has a portico, covered with a dome supported by\r\n
        \ pilasters, and to this door there is an ascent by a flight of plain\r\n
        \ steps. Its square tower has a large Corinthian window adorned with\r\n  columns
        and pilasters. The corners of the tower are also strengthened\r\n  by pilasters,
        which on their tops support vases. The upper stage of\r\n  the tower is plain,
        and extremely heavy, and from this part rises a\r\n  turret at each corner,
        and a more lofty one in the middle.\r\n\r\n  The advowson of this rectory,
        which is not to be held in commendam, is\r\n  in the Principal and Scholars
        of King\u2019s hall, and Brazen-nose College,\r\n  Oxford. _Maitland._\r\n\r\n_St._
        ANN\u2019S _Soho_, owes its foundation to the same cause as the former,\r\n
        \ the increase of public buildings; the inhabitants of the parish of St.\r\n
        \ Martin\u2019s in the Fields became much too numerous to be contained in
        the\r\n  church, and therefore applying to parliament, this was erected in
        the\r\n  year 1686, in a spot of ground then called Kemp\u2019s Field, and
        the\r\n  parish to which it belongs was separated from St. Martin\u2019s in
        1678.\r\n\r\n  The walls of this church are of brick with rustic quoins. The
        tower,\r\n  which is square, is strengthened with a kind of buttresses, and
        at the\r\n  springing of the dome, which supports the lanthorn, there are
        urns on\r\n  the corners with flames. The lanthorn, which is formed of arches,
        is\r\n  surrounded with a balustrade at the bottom, and a turret over it is\r\n
        \ well shaped, and crowned with a globe and fane.\r\n\r\n  The advowson of
        this church is settled upon the Bishop of London, and\r\n  the Rector; instead
        of tithes, receives from the parishioners 100_l._\r\n  a year, which, together
        with the glebe, surplice fees, and Easter\r\n  book, amount to about 300_l._

        in 1666, and the present edifice finished\r\n  in 1682. It is built of stone,
        and is of the Tuscan order, firm and\r\n  massy. The length of the church
        is 66 feet, and the breadth 54. The\r\n  roof is a cupola of an elliptic form,
        enlightened by four port hole\r\n  windows, and supported by composite columns.
        The steeple consists of a\r\n  tower, and a neat spire.\r\n\r\n  The living
        is a rectory, with the parish of St. John Baptist annexed\r\n  to it, and
        the advowson is in the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul\u2019s. The\r\n  Rector

        was formed in this city\r\n  about the year 1580, by some of the most learned
        men in the kingdom:\r\n  but having been frequently interrupted and discontinued,
        very little\r\n  can be said concerning the same till the year 1717, when
        it was again\r\n  revived by a number of gentlemen studious of antiquity in
        general, but\r\n  more particularly desirous to obtain all possible knowledge
        of the\r\n  antiquities of their own country. With this view they agreed to
        meet\r\n  one evening in every week under certain regulations; they encouraged\r\n
        \ correspondencies with all parts of the kingdom; they subscribed an\r\n  annual
        sum to defray the expence of engraving on copper-plates, what\r\n  should
        be thought deserving to be so preserved, and limited their\r\n  number to
        100. And in this manner they continued their weekly meeting\r\n  with great
        reputation, till his Majesty King George II. was graciously\r\n  pleased to
        grant them a royal charter of incorporation, dated Nov. 2,\r\n  1751; and
        to declare himself their founder and patron.\r\n\r\n  Under this charter they
        became a body corporate, by the name of the\r\n  Society of Antiquaries of
        London, with a power to have and use a\r\n  common seal, to sue and be sued,
        and to take, hold, and enjoy by\r\n  purchase, gift, or otherwise, any lands,
        tenements or hereditaments,\r\n  not exceeding in the whole 1000_l._ _per
        annum_. And it is therein\r\n  directed, that the Council of the said Society
        shall at all times\r\n  consist of 21 persons, the President for the time
        being always to be\r\n  one; and the said charter appoints Martin Folkes,
        Esq; to be the first\r\n  President, and also 20 other persons therein named
        to be the first\r\n  Council, empowering them within two months from the date
        thereof, to\r\n  nominate, chuse and admit, as Fellows of the said Society,
        such\r\n  persons as shall excel in the knowledge of the antiquities and history\r\n
        \ of this and other nations, and be eminent for piety, virtue, integrity\r\n
        \ and loyalty. This first President and Council are to continue till the\r\n
        \ 23d day of April next ensuing, on which day, in every year thereafter,\r\n
        \ the Council and Fellows are to assemble to nominate and elect a\r\n  President,
        and Council for the ensuing year; and it is particularly\r\n  directed that
        eleven of the former Council shall be continued, and ten\r\n  other persons
        chosen out of the members of the Society: ten and no\r\n  more of the Council
        being to be changed annually. The President is\r\n  empowered to nominate
        four persons of the Council to be his Deputies,\r\n  and supply his place
        in case of sickness or absence, and the\r\n  President, Council, Fellows,
        or any twenty-one or more, are empowered\r\n  to make statutes, rules, orders
        and by-laws, for the government and\r\n  direction of the said Society, their
        estates, goods, &c. and for the\r\n  admission and amoval of all and every
        the members and officers\r\n  thereof. And the President, Council and Fellows,
        may appoint\r\n  treasurers, secretaries and clerks, may have and employ one
        serjeant\r\n  at mace, and such other servants as they think necessary. And
        lastly,\r\n  if any abuses or differences shall arise, the Archbishop of\r\n
        \ Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor or Keeper of the Great Seal, the Lord\r\n
        \ Privy Seal, and the two Secretaries of State for the time being, are\r\n
        \ appointed Visitors, with full power for any three of them to compose\r\n
        \ and redress such differences and abuses: provision is also made to\r\n  fill
        up any vacancies that may happen by the death of the President or\r\n  any
        of the Council.\r\n\r\n  On the receipt of this charter, the first President
        and Council\r\n  nominated and admitted, by a writing dated the 14th of November
        1751,\r\n  all the former members, together with some others, in the whole
        121,\r\n  to be Fellows of the said Society of Antiquaries of London, and
        soon\r\n  after drew up a body of statutes for the good government thereof,\r\n
        \ which, was unanimously agreed to and confirmed in the month of July\r\n
        \ 1752.\r\n\r\n  It was herein enacted, that the number of members should
        not exceed\r\n  150, but that number being very soon filled up, and several
        men of\r\n  quality and fortune, as well as persons of great learning and\r\n
        \ eminence, being continually applying to become members, which they\r\n  could
        not be till vacancies should happen by death, the Society\r\n  thought proper
        in the year 1755, to enlarge their number to 180, (to\r\n  which they are
        limited at present) exclusive of Peers, Privy\r\n  Councillors and Judges,
        that should be chosen after that time. A\r\n  little before this the Society
        gave up the management of their estate\r\n  and revenues, the payment of monies,
        and the publication of their\r\n  papers and drawings, (which before were
        in the body in general, and\r\n  thereby attended with many inconveniences,)
        entirely to the care of\r\n  their Council, which are now a standing committee
        for that purpose;\r\n  and thereby the government of this Society is become
        nearly the same\r\n  as that of the Royal Society, which was doubtless a proper
        pattern to\r\n  copy after.\r\n\r\n  On the 23d of April, being St. George\u2019s
        day, the Society annually\r\n  elect their Council and officers, _viz._ a
        President, a Treasurer, two\r\n  Secretaries, and a Director, who has the
        care of all their\r\n  publications. Then the President appoints four of the
        Council to be\r\n  his Deputies or Vice-presidents: and after the election
        is over, the\r\n  Society dine together at their own expence. Martin Folkes,
        Esq; was\r\n  annually elected President till his death in 1754, since which
        time\r\n  the Rt. Hon. Lord Willoughby of Parham has been every year chosen.\r\n\r\n
        \ Every person desirous to be elected a Fellow of this Society, except\r\n
        \ Peers, Privy Counsellors, or Judges of Great Britain or Ireland, must\r\n
        \ be recommended by three or more of the members, in a paper signed by\r\n
        \ themselves, specifying the name, addition, profession, and chief\r\n  qualification
        of the candidate, and also the place of his abode. When\r\n  this has been
        read at one of the Society\u2019s meetings, and then hung up\r\n  in their
        public room during the time of four other meetings, the\r\n  election is determined
        by ballot. Peers, Privy Counsellors, and judges\r\n  of Great Britain or Ireland,
        if proposed by any single member, must be\r\n  balloted for immediately. Every
        new member must pay an admission fee\r\n  of five guineas, and sign the obligation,
        whereby he promises, that he\r\n  will to the utmost of his power promote
        the honour and interest of the\r\n  Society, and observe the statutes and
        orders thereof. Which being done\r\n  he is led up to the chair, when the
        President or Vice-President\r\n  rising, takes him by the hand and says these
        words, _viz._ I do, by\r\n  the authority and in the name of the Society of
        Antiquaries of London,\r\n  admit you a Fellow thereof.\r\n\r\n  Every member
        must further pay one guinea annually for the use of the\r\n  Society, or ten
        guineas at once in lieu of all contributions.\r\n\r\n  The meetings of this
        Society are on Thursday evenings weekly, from\r\n  about six till nine o\u2019clock,
        at their house in Chancery lane: their\r\n  business is to receive, read and
        consider all informations from their\r\n  own members, or others, concerning
        the Antiquities of all nations,\r\n  (for which purpose they admit eminent
        foreigners to be correspondent\r\n  members) but they more particularly attend
        to the study of the ancient\r\n  history, customs, manners, grants, charters,
        coins, medals, camps,\r\n  churches, cities, and all monuments whatever, ecclesiastical,\r\n
        \ military, or civil, which are found in or relate to Great Britain and\r\n
        \ Ireland. And the communications they have received concerning these\r\n
        \ matters must be very valuable, as may be judged by the many curious\r\n
        \ remains of antiquity they have caused to be engraven on copper-plates,\r\n
        \ and permitted lately to be sold; tho\u2019 as yet they have not thought
        fit\r\n  to publish any of their dissertations. They have a small but choice\r\n
        \ library, which is increasing daily, also a fine collection of prints\r\n
        \ and drawings.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _A_ TABLE _of the_ ANTIQUITIES _engraved and

        COMPANY. This company was incorporated with that of the\r\n  Grocers by King
        James I. in the year 1606; but they were soon\r\n  separated, and in 1617
        incorporated by the name of the Master, Wardens\r\n  and Society of the art
        and mystery of Apothecaries of the city of\r\n  London, at which time there
        were only 104 Apothecaries shops within\r\n  the city and suburbs.\r\n\r\n
        \ This company is governed by a Master, two Wardens, and twenty-one\r\n  Assistants,
        to whom belong a livery of 144 members, whose fine is\r\n  16_l._ The Apothecaries
        have the privilege of being exempt from parish\r\n  and ward offices.\r\n\r\nAPOTHECARIES
        HALL. This edifice is situated in Blackfriars, and has a\r\n  pair of gates
        leading into an open court handsomely paved with broad\r\n  stones, at the
        upper end of which is the hall built with brick and\r\n  stone, and adorned
        with columns of the Tuscan order. The ceiling of\r\n  the court room and hall
        is ornamented with fret work, and the latter\r\n  wainscotted fourteen feet
        high. In the hall room is the portraiture of\r\n  King James I. and also the
        bust of Dr. Gideon Delaun, that King\u2019s\r\n  apothecary, who was a considerable
        benefactor to the company. In this\r\n  building are two large laboratories,
        one chemical, and the other for\r\n  galenical preparations, where vast quantities
        of the best medicines\r\n  are prepared, for the use of apothecaries and others,
        and particularly\r\n  of the Surgeons of the royal navy, who here make up
        their chests.\r\n\r\n  The Apothecaries company have a spacious and beautiful
        physic garden\r\n  at Chelsea, which contains almost four acres, and is enriched
        with a\r\n  vast variety of plants both domestic and exotic. This was given
        by Sir\r\n  Hans Sloane, Bart. on condition of their paying a quit rent of
        5_l._\r\n  _per annum_, and annually delivering to the President and Fellows
        of\r\n  the Royal Society, at one of their public meetings, fifty specimens
        of\r\n  different sorts of plants, well cured, and of the growth of this\r\n
        \ garden, till the number of specimens amounts to 2000.\r\n\r\nAPPLEBY\u2019S

        As the bishopric of London includes the ancient kingdom of\r\n  the East Saxons,
        which contained the counties of Middlesex, Essex, and\r\n  part of Hertfordshire,
        it has five archdeaconries, _viz._ those of\r\n  London, Essex, Middlesex,
        Colchester, and St. Alban\u2019s. It is the\r\n  office of these Archdeacons
        to visit annually the several cures in\r\n  their respective archdeaconries,
        in order to enquire into the\r\n  deportment of the several incumbents, as
        well as parish officers; to\r\n  advise them gravely to reform what is amiss,
        and in case of contumacy\r\n  to inflict pains and penalties, for which they
        receive procuration\r\n  from every parish priest within their jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nARCHES,
        an ecclesiastical court in Doctors Commons, formerly kept in Bow\r\n  church
        Cheapside, where the church and tower being arched, the court\r\n  was from
        thence called _The Arches_, and still retains the name. As\r\n  this is the
        highest court belonging to the Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\n  hither all appeals
        in ecclesiastical matters within that province are\r\n  directed. The judge
        of this court is stiled the _Dean of the Arches_,\r\n  from his having a jurisdiction
        over a Deanry in London, consisting of\r\n  13 parishes or peculiars exempt
        from the Bishop of London\u2019s\r\n  jurisdiction. The other officers are
        a register, or examiner, an\r\n  actuary, a beadle or crier, and an apparitor;

        by becoming one of their members. To this company, which\r\n  formerly made
        coats of mail, is united that of the brasiers, who are\r\n  jointly governed

        a little north east of\r\n  what is now Devonshire square in Bishopsgate street.
        This was\r\n  originally a spacious field called Tassel Close, from its being\r\n
        \ planted with tassels for the use of the clothworkers. It was\r\n  afterwards
        let to the cross-bow makers, who used to shoot there; but\r\n  being at length
        inclosed with a brick wall, served as an artillery\r\n  ground, to which the
        gunners of the Tower repaired every Thursday,\r\n  when they levelled brass
        pieces of large artillery against a butt of\r\n  earth raised for that purpose.
        The last Prior of St. Mary Spital\r\n  granted to the gunners of the Tower
        this artillery ground for thrice\r\n  ninety nine years, for the use and practice
        of great and small\r\n  artillery; and King Henry VIII. gave the company a
        charter. Hence this\r\n  artillery ground became subject to the Tower; the
        streets, &c. compose\r\n  one of the Tower hamlets, and the inhabitants are
        still summoned on\r\n  juries belonging to the courts held on Tower hill.\r\n\r\n
        \ In the year 1585, the city being put to great trouble and expence by\r\n
        \ the continual musters and training of soldiers, some brave and active\r\n
        \ citizens, who had obtained experience both at home and abroad,\r\n  voluntarily
        exercised themselves, and trained up others in the use of\r\n  arms, so that
        within two years there were almost three hundred\r\n  merchants, and other
        persons of distinction, qualified to teach the\r\n  common soldiers the management
        of their guns, pikes, and halberts, as\r\n  well as to march and countermarch.
        These met every Thursday, each\r\n  person by turns bearing office from the
        corporal to the captain, and\r\n  some of these gentlemen had the honour of
        having a body of forces\r\n  under their command at the great camp of Tilbury,
        in the year 1588,\r\n  when the Spaniards sent against us their pretended
        invincible Armada,\r\n  and these commanders were generally called Captains
        of the Artillery\r\n  Garden.\r\n\r\n  This noble exercise became afterwards
        discontinued for a long time,\r\n  but was renewed in the year 1610, when
        several gentlemen having\r\n  obtained the permission of King James I. undertook
        at their private\r\n  expence a weekly exercise in the same artillery ground,
        and in the\r\n  year 1662, erected an armoury, in which they placed 500 sets
        of arms,\r\n  of extraordinary beauty and workmanship. The Artillery company
        now\r\n  greatly increased, and the people resorted to the artillery ground
        to\r\n  learn to defend themselves and their country; and even many gentlemen\r\n
        \ from every county went thither to learn martial exercises, in order to\r\n
        \ teach them to the militia, in the distant parts of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n
        \ At length this company being so much increased that this artillery\r\n  ground
        was scarcely able to contain them, for they amounted to about\r\n  6000: they
        removed to the New Artillery Ground near the upper end of\r\n  Moorfields,
        where they still continue to assemble.\r\n\r\n  King Charles II. when Prince
        of Wales enlisted himself into this\r\n  company, as did his brother James
        Duke of York, at the same time; who\r\n  after the restoration took upon himself
        the command, and named it his\r\n  own company.\r\n\r\n  The Artillery company
        consists of about 300 men. It is governed by a\r\n  President, Vice-president,
        Treasurer and Court of Assistants. The Lord\r\n  Mayor, Aldermen and Sheriffs
        for the time being, &c. with the Field\r\n  Officers of the militia or trained
        bands, are of the honorary court,\r\n  these with 24 gentlemen annually elected,
        compose the court of\r\n  Assistants. His Majesty is Captain-General, and
        all the other officers\r\n  are elected annually, and serve by rotation.\r\n\r\n
        \ The New Artillery Ground is a spacious square walled round. In the\r\n  center
        of the north side is the Armoury, a neat building of brick and\r\n  stone
        strengthened with rustic quoins at the corners; before it is a\r\n  flight
        of steps, and there are a few others at the door, which is in\r\n  the center,
        and is large, lofty, and adorned with a porch formed by\r\n  two Tuscan columns
        and two pilasters supporting a balcony. The front\r\n  is ornamented with
        a pediment supported at the corners by quoins. On\r\n  the top are placed
        several large balls, and on the apex of the\r\n  pediment is a lofty flag
        staff. On each side the main building, stands\r\n  at some distance backwards
        a small edifice, where the provisions are\r\n  dress\u2019d at the company\u2019s
        feasts. The hall of the armoury is hung round\r\n  with breast-plates, helmets
        and drums; and fronting the entrance is a\r\n  handsome pair of iron gates
        which lead to a spacious staircase,\r\n  painted with military ornaments,
        and adorned with the statue of a man\r\n  dressed in a compleat suit of armour.
        This staircase leads into a very\r\n  spacious room, which has the King\u2019s
        arms over one fire place, and\r\n  those of the company over the other. It
        has two chandeliers, and is\r\n  adorned with very fine guns, swords and bayonets,
        presented by the\r\n  officers of the company, and handsomely disposed on
        the walls. There\r\n  are here also tables hung up, containing the names of
        the subscribers\r\n  to the iron gates and other ornaments, among whom is
        King George I.\r\n  who gave 500_l._ Besides the rooms already mentioned,
        there are two\r\n  others above, and two below.\r\n\r\nARTILLERY _court_,

        \ _Society for the encouragement of_ ARTS, MANUFACTURES _and_ COMMERCE.\r\n
        \ The public spirit of this age is perhaps in no instance more\r\n  remarkably
        shewn than in the flourishing condition of this valuable\r\n  Society, whose
        sole object is the improvement of the polite and\r\n  commercial arts in all
        their various branches, by exciting industry\r\n  and emulation amongst all
        who can be moved either by honorary or\r\n  pecuniary rewards. It was set
        on foot by Lord Folkstone, Lord Romney,\r\n  Dr. Hales, and seven or eight
        private gentlemen, who were brought\r\n  together by the unwearied pains of
        Mr. William Shipley, a person\r\n  little known, who had long laboured to
        reduce into practice a scheme\r\n  he had projected for this purpose. Their
        first meeting was at\r\n  Rathmill\u2019s coffee-house, March 22d 1754, when
        those noble Lords\r\n  approved and patronized the undertaking. At their next
        meeting they\r\n  determined to make a beginning, by proposing rewards for
        the discovery\r\n  of cobalt, for the encouragement of boys and girls in the
        art of\r\n  drawing, (thereby to improve manufactures in taste and elegance,)
        and\r\n  for the planting of madder in this kingdom. And now money being\r\n
        \ wanted, a voluntary subscription was begun, to which the two noblemen\r\n
        \ before named, did not only generously contribute much more than they\r\n
        \ would let appear, but engaged moreover to make good the deficiencies\r\n
        \ at the end of the year: a promise they most honourably fulfilled. Soon\r\n
        \ after this, a plan was drawn up by one of the members (Mr. Baker) for\r\n
        \ forming, regulating and governing the Society, which being printed and\r\n
        \ dispersed, the great utility of such a society became so well\r\n  understood,
        that immediately several noblemen and gentlemen offered\r\n  themselves as
        members, and ever since that time its increase has been\r\n  so extraordinary,
        that it consists at present of above 1000 members,\r\n  many of whom are of
        the greatest quality and fortune: and it can now\r\n  afford to offer premiums
        to the amount of near 2000_l._ _per annum_.\r\n\r\n  The officers of this
        Society are a President, eight Vice-presidents, a\r\n  Register, and a Secretary;
        and these are to be chosen by ballot\r\n  annually on the first Tuesday in
        March. Every person desiring to be a\r\n  member of this Society, must be
        proposed by some member of the same at\r\n  one of their meetings, by delivering
        in the name, addition, and place\r\n  of abode of such person, signed by himself;
        which must be read by the\r\n  Secretary, and balloted for at the next meeting,
        and if two thirds of\r\n  the members then present are for admitting such
        person, he shall be\r\n  deemed a perpetual member on payment of twenty guineas,
        or a\r\n  subscribing member on payment of any sum not less than two guineas,\r\n
        \ and continuing such payment annually: but tho\u2019 two guineas a year is\r\n
        \ the most common subscription, all the members that are noblemen, and\r\n
        \ even some gentlemen, subscribe five guineas, and several others four\r\n
        \ or three. There are also ladies that are subscribers; eminent\r\n  foreigners
        are likewise admitted to be honorary members. At first they\r\n  had a Treasurer,
        but now their money is placed in the Bank of England,\r\n  in the names of
        the President and Vice-presidents, three whereof are\r\n  impowered to draw
        any sum the Society shall order to be paid. And the\r\n  accounts of the receipts
        and payments are constantly examined and\r\n  balanced on the last day of
        every month, by a committee appointed for\r\n  that purpose. Their proceedings
        are regulated by a body of rules and\r\n  orders established by the whole
        Society, and printed for the use of\r\n  the members. All questions and debates
        are determined by holding up of\r\n  hands, or by ballot if required, and
        no matter can be confirmed\r\n  without the assent of a majority at two meetings.
        They invite all the\r\n  world to propose subjects for encouragement, and
        whatever is deemed\r\n  deserving attention is referred to the consideration
        of a committee,\r\n  which after due enquiry and deliberation make their report
        to the\r\n  whole Society, where it is approved, rejected or altered. A list
        is\r\n  printed and published every year, of the matters for which they\r\n
        \ propose to give premiums, which premiums are either sums of money, and\r\n
        \ those sometimes very considerable ones, or the Society\u2019s medal in gold\r\n
        \ or silver[1], which they consider as the greatest honour they can\r\n  bestow.
        All possible care is taken to prevent partiality in the\r\n  distribution
        of their premiums, by desiring the claimants names may be\r\n  concealed,
        and by appointing committees, (who when they find occasion\r\n  call to their
        assistance the most skilful artists) for the strict\r\n  examination of the
        real merit of all matters and things brought before\r\n  them, in consequence
        of their premiums.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n    The weight of the Society\u2019s
        medal in gold is about six guineas, and\r\n    proportionably in silver. On
        one side Minerva, as Goddess of Wisdom,\r\n    is represented introducing
        Mercury with a purse in his hand, as the\r\n    God of commercial arts, to
        Britannia sitting on a globe: the\r\n    inscription in the Circle, ARTS.

        that the name of the\r\n    person to whom, and the occasion for which each
        medal is given, may\r\n    be engraved thereon. The dye was made by Mr. Pingo,
        and is thought\r\n    to be well done.\r\n\r\n  The Society\u2019s office
        is opposite to Beaufort Buildings in the Strand:\r\n  their meetings are every
        Wednesday evening at six o\u2019clock, from the\r\n  second Wednesday in November
        to the last Wednesday in May, and at\r\n  other times on the first and third
        Wednesday of every month. They are\r\n  exceedingly well attended, and \u2019tis
        pleasing to behold with how\r\n  laudable a zeal every one endeavours to promote
        the public good, by\r\n  encouraging whatever may improve the arts and manufactures,
        or\r\n  increase the commerce of this kingdom and its colonies. They are not\r\n
        \ incorporated, nor seem much to want a charter, as their business can\r\n
        \ be carried on very well without one, and the expence would be too\r\n  considerable;
        but it is hoped their generous disinterested intentions,\r\n  and their extensive
        views to promote the trade, the riches and honour\r\n  of their country, will
        in time recommend them to partake the royal\r\n  bounty, and that they will
        long continue to prove themselves to be,\r\n  what they are at present, as
        respectable and useful a society as ever\r\n  was established in any nation.\r\n\r\nARUNDEL

        building and endowing it, in order\r\n  to afford lodging and board for twenty
        poor men of that company, and\r\n  for as many boys to be instructed in reading,
        writing, and arithmetic.\r\n  Each of the pensioners hath an apartment consisting
        of three neat\r\n  rooms, with proper diet at a common table, and firing;
        the annual sum\r\n  of 3_l._ and a gown every second year: which, together
        with the\r\n  salaries of the chaplain, clerk, butler, porter, and other domestics,\r\n
        \ amount to about 800_l._ _per annum_.\r\n\r\n  A plan of the building was
        drawn by Dr. Hook, a learned mathematician\r\n  of Gresham College, and upon
        his model it was erected in an\r\n  advantageous situation, fronting the east,
        with grass plats before it,\r\n  adorned with rows of lime trees, and inclosed
        with a handsome wall and\r\n  iron gates. On the piers of the great gates

        Hospital men, in full\r\n  proportion. The principal part of the building
        is only one story high\r\n  with garrets; where a portico with twenty-one
        stone pillars extends on\r\n  a line on each side of the chapel, which is
        placed in the middle, and\r\n  on each side above these pillars is a range
        of twenty-two very small\r\n  windows. The pillars of the chapel extend to
        the top of the first\r\n  story, and that edifice rising considerably above
        the rest of the\r\n  building, is terminated by a handsome pediment; with

        will find a noble foundation formed for the reception of those\r\n  unhappy
        women, who have been abandoned to vice; but wisely repenting\r\n  of their
        folly, resolve to reform. This charitable foundation of which\r\n  we are
        now going to give a description, was founded at the same time,\r\n  in order
        to preserve poor friendless and deserted girls, from the\r\n  miseries and
        dangers to which they would be exposed, and from the\r\n  guilt of prostitution.\r\n\r\n
        \ The evils this charity is intended to prevent, are not chimerical, but\r\n
        \ founded on facts. It too often happens, that by the death of the\r\n  father,
        a mother intitled to no relief from any parish, is left with\r\n  several
        helpless children, to be supplied from her industry; her\r\n  resource for
        subsistence is usually to some low occupation, scarcely\r\n  sufficient to
        afford bread and cloathing, and rarely the means of\r\n  instruction. What
        then must become of the daughters of such parents,\r\n  poor and illiterate
        as they are, and thereby exposed to every\r\n  temptation? Necessity may make
        them prostitutes, even before their\r\n  passions can have any share in their
        guilt. Among these unhappy\r\n  objects, very agreeable features are frequently
        seen disguised amidst\r\n  dirt and rags, and this still exposes them to greater
        hazards; for\r\n  these are the girls which the vile procuress seeks after;
        she trepans\r\n  them to her brothel, even while they are yet children, and
        she cleans\r\n  and dresses them up for prostitution. But what is still more
        dreadful,\r\n  maternal duty and affection have been so thoroughly obliterated,
        that\r\n  even mothers themselves have been the seducers: they have insnared\r\n
        \ their children to the house of the procuress, and shared with her the\r\n
        \ infamous gain of initiating their daughters in lewdness: or if this\r\n
        \ has not been the case, they have too often been prevailed on, for a\r\n
        \ trifling consideration, to conceal and forgive the crime of the\r\n  infamous
        bawd.\r\n\r\n  These and other considerations induced a number of Noblemen
        and\r\n  Gentlemen, who had approved of a proposal from John Fielding, Esq;
        one\r\n  of the Justices for the Liberties of Westminster, to hold their first\r\n
        \ meeting on the 10th of May 1758, for carrying into execution a plan of\r\n
        \ this Asylum. Several other meetings were soon after held, in which the\r\n
        \ rules and orders for the reception and management of the children were\r\n
        \ established, and the lease of a house, lately the Hercules Inn near\r\n
        \ Westminster-bridge, agreed for. This house was soon fitted up, and\r\n  furnished,
        and the first children admitted on the 5th of July\r\n  following.\r\n\r\n
        \ The rules and orders established are as follows:\r\n\r\n  I. The qualification
        of a perpetual Guardian is a benefaction of\r\n  thirty guineas or upwards,
        at one payment.\r\n\r\n  II. That of an annual Guardian is a subscription
        of three guineas or\r\n  upwards per annum.\r\n\r\n  III. Ladies subscribing
        the said sums, will be considered as Guardians\r\n  of this charity, and have
        a right of voting at all general elections,\r\n  by proxy, such proxy being
        a Guardian, or they may send a letter to\r\n  the board, naming therein the
        person they vote for, which shall be\r\n  considered as their vote. It is
        esteemed by the Guardians a benefit to\r\n  the charity, for the Ladies occasionally
        to visit the house, and\r\n  inspect the management of the children; the matron
        being ordered to\r\n  attend such Ladies, and to give them all necessary information:
        and,\r\n  whatever observations they may then make, or whatever hints, at
        other\r\n  times, may occur to them, for the good of the charity, if they
        will be\r\n  pleased to transmit them by letter to the Secretary, or to the\r\n
        \ Committee, who meet every Wednesday in the forenoon at the Asylum,\r\n  they
        will be immediately taken into consideration, and have all\r\n  respectful
        regard shewn to them.\r\n\r\n  IV. Those Gentlemen and Ladies, who have already
        subscribed lesser\r\n  sums than thirty guineas, by making up their subscriptions
        to that\r\n  sum, within a year, will be entered in the subscription book
        as\r\n  perpetual Guardians.\r\n\r\n  V. There is to be an annual general
        meeting of the Guardians on the\r\n  second Wednesday in March.\r\n\r\n  VI.
        A general quarterly meeting is to be held on the second Wednesday\r\n  in
        July, the second Wednesday in January, the second Wednesday in\r\n  April,
        and the second Wednesday in October, for auditing the accounts,\r\n  and making
        laws and rules for the government of the charity, and for\r\n  other business.\r\n\r\n
        \ VII. A Committee is appointed, to consist of thirty Guardians, who are\r\n
        \ to meet every Wednesday at eleven o\u2019clock in the forenoon at the\r\n
        \ Asylum, to transact the business of the charity; and they are, from\r\n
        \ time to time, to report their proceedings to the following general\r\n  court,
        and any three of the said gentlemen constitute a quorum. In\r\n  these Committees
        are a President, Vice-president, and a Treasurer.\r\n\r\n  VIII. The officers
        and servants of the house, are a Physician, two\r\n  Surgeons, an Apothecary
        and a Chaplain.\r\n\r\n  A Secretary, who keeps the accounts of the hospital,
        and does all such\r\n  other business as is commonly done by Secretaries,
        Clerks, and\r\n  Registers, at other charities.\r\n\r\n  A Matron, who superintends
        the affairs of the house, takes care of the\r\n  provisions and furniture,
        delivers an account of the current expences\r\n  weekly to the Secretary,
        to be laid before the Committee. She is to\r\n  see that the children are
        properly employed, that they are attentive\r\n  to their learning, and that
        they behave with decency; that the\r\n  teachers do their duty, and that they
        treat the children with\r\n  humanity. The servants under her, are teachers
        of reading, knitting,\r\n  sewing, &c. a cook, a house-maid, and a servant
        man.\r\n\r\n  IX. The objects to be admitted are Orphans, the daughters of\r\n
        \ necessitous parents, residing in parishes where they have no relief,\r\n
        \ and deserted girls within the bills of mortality, from eight to twelve\r\n
        \ years of age; but infirm children are not admitted, as the objects of\r\n
        \ this charity are to be constantly employed in every branch of good\r\n  housewifry.\r\n\r\n
        \ X. Each object applying for admission, must produce such certificate\r\n
        \ of her age and necessity, as shall be satisfactory to the Guardians\r\n
        \ then present; and in all cases, wherein, during the infancy of this\r\n
        \ Asylum, more objects shall apply for admission than the Asylum can at\r\n
        \ once receive, the names of the objects not admitted are entered in a\r\n
        \ book kept for that purpose, and a notice is sent to the persons,\r\n  signifying
        the certificate of each child, of the first opportunity of\r\n  taking in
        such children that shall happen afterwards; in filling up\r\n  all which,
        the children, before refused, have the preference as they\r\n  stand upon
        the entry: each of the above certificates must be signed by\r\n  two substantial
        housekeepers, of the parish where the object resides.\r\n\r\n  XI. The children
        are regularly and alternately employed in reading,\r\n  knitting, sewing,
        and in the business of the kitchen, to which latter\r\n  employment four are
        appointed weekly, to be with the cook, to assist\r\n  her, and to receive
        from her the necessary instructions in plain\r\n  cookery, curing provisions,
        and other employments of the kitchen. They\r\n  likewise make the beds, clean
        the rooms, assist in washing, and\r\n  ironing the linen, and in other household
        business, according to their\r\n  respective ages and abilities, at the discretion
        of the matron.\r\n\r\n  XII. The Chaplain on Sundays preaches, and performs
        the other parts of\r\n  divine service, and catechises the children. Prayers
        also are read on\r\n  the other days of the week, by the matron or teacher;
        and some portion\r\n  of scripture is read by those of the children who are
        best able. They\r\n  have also, each of them, a common prayer book, and the
        new testament;\r\n  and other good books are likewise provided for them.\r\n\r\n
        \ The number of children in the house in April 1759, were forty-two, and\r\n
        \ the sums raised for the support of this charitable foundation, at the\r\n
        \ same time, amounted to 2032_l._ 4_s._ 9_d._\r\n\r\nAUDLEY\u2019S _rents_,

        This office belongs to\r\n  a corporation, established by an act passed in
        the second and third\r\n  years of the reign of Queen Anne, for the better
        maintenance of the\r\n  poor Clergy, by the augmentation of small livings.
        This body corporate\r\n  consists of the Lords of the Privy Council, the Lords

        \ court, provided three of that number be a Privy Counsellor, a Bishop,\r\n
        \ a Judge, or one of the King\u2019s Council, and this court may appoint\r\n
        \ committees of Governors, and invest them with such powers as they\r\n  think
        proper.\r\n\r\n  The business of the Governors is to find out the value of
        every\r\n  benefice under 80_l._ a Year, with the distance of each from London,\r\n
        \ &c. and to lay the state thereof before his Majesty, with the value of\r\n
        \ the tenths, first-fruits, &c. in order that the royal bounty may be\r\n
        \ applied to support those of the clergy, who are in the greatest\r\n  distress:
        and this corporation has actually augmented a great number\r\n  of small livings.\r\n\r\nAUSTIN
        FRIARS, near Broad street, was a priory founded for the Friars\r\n  Eremites,
        of the order of St. Augustine, in the year 1253, by Humphrey\r\n  Bohun, Earl
        of Hereford and Essex, The Friars of this priory were\r\n  Mendicants, and
        continued in the possession of this place till its\r\n  dissolution by King
        Henry VIII. since which time the greatest part has\r\n  been pulled down,
        and many handsome houses built; but a part of the\r\n  old church belonging
        to the priory is still standing. King Edward VI.\r\n  granted all the church,
        except the choir, to a congregation of\r\n  Germans, and other strangers,
        who fled hither for the sake of\r\n  religion, ordering it to be called _the
        Temple of the Lord Jesus_, and\r\n  several successive Princes have confirmed
        it to the Dutch, by whom it\r\n  is still used as a place of divine worship.
        It is a large and spacious\r\n  Gothic edifice, supported by two rows of stone
        pillars. At the east\r\n  end are several steps, which lead to a large platform,
        on which is\r\n  placed a long table with seats against the wall, and forms
        round, for\r\n  the use of the Holy Communion, and the windows on one side
        have\r\n  painted on them in several places, the words JESUS TEMPLE. On the
        west\r\n  end over the screen is a library, thus inscribed, _Ecclesi\xE6\r\n
        \ Londino-Belgic\xE6 Bibliotheca, extructa sumptibus_ Mari\xE6 Dubois 1659.
        It\r\n  contains several valuable manuscripts, among which are the letters
        of\r\n  Calvin, Peter Martyr, and other foreign reformers.\r\n\r\n_St._ AUSTIN\u2019S

        The old church having suffered in the dreadful\r\n  conflagration in 1666,
        has been rebuilt, and the parish of St. Faith\r\n  united to it. It is a rectory,
        and the advowson is in the Dean and\r\n  Chapter of St. Paul\u2019s. The Rector

        Mile End, were\r\n  erected by the Drapers company in the year 1735, pursuant
        to the will\r\n  of Mr. Francis Bancroft, who bequeathed to that company the
        sum of\r\n  28,000_l._ and upwards, in real and personal estates, for purchasing
        a\r\n  site, and building upon it an almshouse, with convenient apartments\r\n
        \ for twenty-four almsmen, a chapel, and school room for 100 poor boys,\r\n
        \ and two dwelling-houses for the schoolmasters, and endowing the same.\r\n
        \ He also ordered that each of the almsmen should have 8_l._ and half a\r\n
        \ chaldron of coals yearly, and a gown of baize every third year; that\r\n
        \ the school boys should be cloathed and taught reading, writing and\r\n  arithmetic;
        that each of the masters, besides their houses, should\r\n  have a salary
        of 30_l._ _per annum_, and the yearly sum of 20_l._ for\r\n  coals and candles,
        for their use, and that of the school; with a\r\n  sufficient allowance for
        books, paper, pens and ink; that the\r\n  committee of the court of assistants
        should have 5_l._ for a dinner,\r\n  at their annual visitation of the almshouse
        and school; and that 3_l._\r\n  10_s._ should be given for two half yearly
        sermons to be preached in\r\n  the parish churches of St. Helen and St. Michael
        Cornhill, or\r\n  elsewhere, in commemoration of this foundation, at which
        the almsmen\r\n  and boys were to be present. To each of these boys, when
        put out\r\n  apprentices, he gave 4_l._ but if they were put to service they
        were\r\n  to have no more than 2_l._ 10_s._ to buy them cloaths.\r\n\r\n  The
        edifice is not only neat but extremely elegant, consisting of two\r\n  wings
        and a center detached from both of them. In the middle of the\r\n  front is
        the chapel, before which is a noble portico, with Ionic\r\n  columns, and
        coupled pilasters at the corners, supporting a pediment,\r\n  in the plane
        of which is the dial. There is an ascent to the portico\r\n  by a flight of
        steps, and over the chapel is a handsome turret. On\r\n  each side of the
        portico, are two houses like those in the wings. The\r\n  construction of
        the wings is uniform, lofty and convenient: twelve\r\n  doors in each open
        in a regular series, and the windows are of a\r\n  moderate size, numerous,
        and proportioned to the apartments they are\r\n  to enlighten. The square
        is surrounded with gravel walks. with a large\r\n  grass plat in the middle,
        and next the road the wall is adorned with\r\n  handsome iron rails and gates.
        In short, the ends of the wings next\r\n  the road being placed at a considerable
        distance from it, the whole is\r\n  seen in a proper point of view, and appears
        to the greatest advantage.\r\n\r\n  It is worthy of remark, that this Bancroft,
        who left so large a sum\r\n  for erecting and endowing this fine hospital,
        and even ordered two\r\n  sermons to be annually preached in commemoration
        of his charity, was,\r\n  according to the last edition of _Stow\u2019s Survey_,
        one of the Lord\r\n  Mayor\u2019s officers, and by informations and summoning
        the citizens\r\n  before the Lord Mayor, upon the most trifling occasions,
        and other\r\n  things not belonging to his office, not only pillaged the poor
        but\r\n  also many of the rich, who rather than lose time in appearing before\r\n
        \ that Magistrate, gave money to get rid of this common pest of the\r\n  citizens,
        which, together with his numerous quarterages from the\r\n  brokers, &c. enabled
        him to amass annually a considerable sum of\r\n  money. But by these and other
        mercenary practices, he so incurred the\r\n  hatred and ill-will of the citizens
        of all ranks and denominations,\r\n  that the persons who attended his funeral
        obsequies, with great\r\n  difficulty saved his corpse from being jostled
        off the bearers\r\n  shoulders in the church, by the enraged populace, who
        seizing the\r\n  bells, rang them for joy at his unlamented death.\r\n\r\nBANDYLEG

        OF ENGLAND. This is a noble edifice, situated at the east of St.\r\n  Christopher\u2019s
        church, near the west end of Threadneedle street. The\r\n  front next the
        street is about 80 feet in length, and is of the Ionic\r\n  order raised on
        a rustic basement, as is represented in the print, and\r\n  is in a good style.
        Through this you pass into the court yard, in\r\n  which is the hall. This
        is of the Corinthian order, and in the middle\r\n  is a pediment. The top
        of the building is adorned with a balustrade\r\n  and handsome vases, and
        in the face of the above pediment is engraved,\r\n  in relievo, the Company\u2019s
        seal, Britannia sitting with her shield and\r\n  spear, and at her feet a
        Cornucopia, pouring out fruit. The hall,\r\n  which is in this last building,
        is 79 feet in length, and 40 in\r\n  breadth; it is wainscoted about eight
        feet high; has a fine fretwork\r\n  ceiling, and is adorned with the statue

        the Year of our Lord MDCCXXXIV.\r\n                   And the first Year of
        this Building.\r\n\r\n  Farther backward is another quadrangle, with an arcade
        on the east and\r\n  west sides of it; and on the north side is the accomptant\u2019s
        office,\r\n  which is 60 feet long, and 28 feet broad. Over this, and the
        other\r\n  sides of the quadrangle, are handsome apartments, with a fine\r\n
        \ staircase adorned with fretwork, and under it are large vaults, that\r\n
        \ have strong walls and iron gates, for the preservation of the cash.\r\n
        \ The back entrance from Bartholomew lane is by a grand gateway, which\r\n
        \ opens into a commodious and spacious court yard for coaches, or\r\n  waggons,
        that frequently come loaded with gold and silver bullion; and\r\n  in the
        room fronting the gate the transfer office is kept.\r\n\r\n  The Bank was
        established by act of Parliament in the year 1693, under\r\n  the title of
        _The Governor and Company of the Bank of England_, in\r\n  consideration of
        a loan of 1,200,000_l._ granted to the government,\r\n  for which the subscribers
        received eight _per cent._ By this charter,\r\n  the Company are not to borrow
        under their common seal, unless by act\r\n  of parliament; they are not to
        trade, or suffer any person in trust\r\n  for them to trade in goods or merchandize;
        but may deal in bills of\r\n  exchange, in buying or selling bullion, and
        foreign gold, or silver\r\n  coin, &c.\r\n\r\n  By an act passed in the 8th
        and 9th years of the reign of King William\r\n  III. they were empowered to
        enlarge their capital to 2,201,171_l._\r\n  10_s._ It was then also enacted,
        that bank stock should be a personal\r\n  and not a real estate; that no contract,
        either in word or writing,\r\n  for buying or selling bank stock, should be
        good in law, unless\r\n  registered in the books of the bank within seven
        days, and the stock\r\n  transferred within fourteen days; and that it should
        be felony,\r\n  without benefit of clergy, to counterfeit the common seal
        of the Bank,\r\n  any sealed bank bill, any bank note, or to alter or erase
        such bills\r\n  or notes.\r\n\r\n  In the 7th of Queen Anne, the Company were,
        by another act, impowered\r\n  to increase their capital to 4,402,343_l._
        and at the same time they\r\n  advanced 400,000_l._ more to the government;
        and in 1714, they\r\n  advanced the sum of 1,500,000_l._\r\n\r\n  In the third
        year of the reign of King George I. the interest of their\r\n  capital was
        reduced to 5_l._ _per cent._ when the Bank agreed to\r\n  deliver up as many
        Exchequer bills as amounted to two millions, and to\r\n  accept of an annuity
        of 100,000_l._ _per annum_. It was also declared\r\n  lawful for the Bank
        to call for from their members, in proportion to\r\n  their interests in the
        capital stock, such sums, as in a general court\r\n  should be found necessary;
        but if any member should neglect to pay his\r\n  share of the money so called
        for, at the time appointed, by notice in\r\n  the London Gazette and fixed
        up in the Royal Exchange, it should be\r\n  lawful for the Bank, not only
        to stop the dividend of such member, and\r\n  to apply it towards the payment
        of the money so called for, but also\r\n  to stop the transfers of such defaulter,
        and to charge him with an\r\n  interest of 5_l._ _per cent._ _per annum_,
        for the money so omitted to\r\n  be paid; and if the principal and interest
        should be three months\r\n  unpaid, the Bank should have power to sell so
        much of the stock\r\n  belonging to the defaulter as would satisfy the same.
        This stock is\r\n  now called Bank Circulation, every proprietor of which
        receives 5_l._\r\n  _per cent._ _per annum_, but is obliged to advance, if
        called for,\r\n  1000_l._ for every 100_l._ so paid in.\r\n\r\n  The Bank
        afterwards consented to have the interest of two millions\r\n  still due from
        the government, reduced from 5 to 4 _per cent._ The\r\n  Company also purchased
        several other annuities, that were afterwards\r\n  redeemed by the government,
        and the national debt due to the Bank was\r\n  reduced to 1,600,000.\r\n\r\n
        \ At length in 1742, the Company agreed to supply the government with\r\n
        \ 1,600,000_l._ at 3_l._ _per cent._, by which means the government\r\n  became
        indebted to the Company 3,200,000_l._ the one half carrying 4,\r\n  and the
        other 3 _per cent._\r\n\r\n  In 1746, the Company consented that the sum of
        986,800_l._ due to them\r\n  in Exchequer bills unsatisfied, on the duties
        for licences to sell\r\n  spirituous liquors by retail, should be cancelled,
        and in lieu thereof\r\n  to accept of an annuity of 39,442_l._ the interest
        of that sum at\r\n  4_l._ _per cent._ The Company also agreed to advance the
        farther sum\r\n  of 1,000,000_l._ upon the credit of the duties arising by
        the malt and\r\n  land tax, at 4_l._ _per cent._ for Exchequer bills to be
        issued for\r\n  that purpose, in consideration of which the Company were enabled
        to\r\n  augment their capital with 986,800_l._ the interest of which, as well\r\n
        \ as that of the other annuities, was reduced to 3_l._ 10_s._ _per\r\n  cent._
        till the 25th of December 1757, and from that time they carry\r\n  only 3_l._
        _per cent._\r\n\r\n  In short, several other sums have since been raised by
        the Bank for\r\n  the service of the government: but the above is sufficient
        to give a\r\n  full idea of the nature of the several species of annuities;
        only it\r\n  may be proper to add, that what is called Bank Stock is entirely\r\n
        \ distinct from these, and may not improperly be termed, the trading\r\n  stock
        of the Company, since with this they discount bills, and deal\r\n  very largely
        in foreign gold, &c. which they only buy by weight, which\r\n  trade is so
        very considerable, as to render a share in this stock very\r\n  valuable,
        tho\u2019 it is not equal in value to the East India stock. The\r\n  Company
        make dividends of the profits half yearly. _Pocket Library._\r\n\r\n                  *

        _S. Wales delin._ _J. Green sc. Oxon._ _Banqueting\r\n  House._]\r\n\r\n\r\nBANQUETING
        HOUSE, Whitehall, so called from there being originally in\r\n  this place
        an edifice in which our Kings had public entertainments.\r\n  This was a small
        part of the ancient palace of Whitehall, which was\r\n  destroyed by fire
        in 1697, and only the Banqueting House, and one\r\n  court left standing.
        See the article WHITEHALL.\r\n\r\n  In the reign of King James I. the Banqueting
        House being in a ruinous\r\n  condition, that Monarch formed the design of
        erecting a palace on the\r\n  spot, worthy the residence of the Kings of England.
        The celebrated\r\n  Inigo Jones was employed to draw the plan of a noble edifice;
        this was\r\n  done, and the present structure erected, as a small part of
        the great\r\n  intended work, for the reception of ambassadors, and other
        audiences\r\n  of state. The engraved view of it, which is here given, will
        best\r\n  illustrate what follows.\r\n\r\n  This is a regular and august building
        which has three stories. The\r\n  lowest has a rustic wall, with small square
        windows, and by its\r\n  strength happily serves for a basis for the orders.
        Upon this is\r\n  raised the Ionic, with columns and pilasters, and between
        the columns\r\n  are well-proportioned windows, with arched and pointed pediments.
        Over\r\n  these is placed the proper entablature, and on this is raised a
        second\r\n  series of the Corinthian order, consisting of columns and pilasters\r\n
        \ like the other; column being placed over column, and pilaster over\r\n  pilaster.
        From the capitals are carried festoons, which meet with\r\n  masks and other
        ornaments in the middle. This series is also crowned\r\n  with its proper
        entablature, on which is raised the balustrade with\r\n  Attic pedestals between,
        which crown the work. Every thing in this\r\n  building is finely proportioned,
        and as happily executed. The\r\n  projection of the columns from the wall
        has a fine effect in the\r\n  entablatures, which being brought forward in
        the same proportion,\r\n  gives that happy diversity of light and shade so
        essential to fine\r\n  architecture. _English Architecture._\r\n\r\n  To render
        this edifice as perfect as possible, the ceiling is finely\r\n  painted by
        the celebrated Sir Peter Paul Rubens, who was ambassador\r\n  here in the
        time of Charles I. The subject is the entrance,\r\n  inauguration, and coronation
        of King James I. represented by Pagan\r\n  emblems. It is esteemed one of
        his most capital performances, and may\r\n  be justly esteemed one of the
        finest ceilings in the world. This great\r\n  apartment is at present converted
        into a chapel, for the service of\r\n  which certain select preachers were
        appointed out of each university,\r\n  by King George I. to preach here every
        Sunday; for this each are\r\n  allowed a stipend of 30_l._ a year.\r\n\r\nBANSTED,
        a village in Surrey, situated between Dorking and Croydon,\r\n  famous for
        producing a great number of walnuts; but much more for its\r\n  neighbouring
        Downs, one of the most delightful spots in England, on\r\n  account of the
        agreeable seats in that neighbourhood; for the\r\n  extensive prospect of
        several counties on both sides the Thames, and\r\n  even of the royal palaces
        of Windsor and Hampton Court; and for the\r\n  fineness of the turf, covered

        their baptizing by\r\n  immersing the body all over, and from their not considering
        infants as\r\n  proper subjects of baptism. They are principally divided into
        two\r\n  classes, termed general and particular. The general Baptists, who
        with\r\n  Arminius maintain the doctrine of universal redemption, consist
        of\r\n  only six congregations, who have their meeting-houses as follows:\r\n\r\n

        The art of surgery was anciently practised in this city by none\r\n  but the
        Barbers, who were incorporated by letters patent granted by\r\n  King Edward
        IV. in the Year 1461, and in 1512 an act was passed to\r\n  prevent any persons
        besides the Barbers practising surgery within the\r\n  city of London, and
        seven miles round. At length several persons, who\r\n  were not Barbers, being
        examined and admitted as practitioners in the\r\n  art of surgery, the parliament
        united them in the thirty-second year\r\n  of the reign of King Henry VIII.
        by the appellation of _the Masters or\r\n  Governors of the mystery or commonalty
        of Barbers and Surgeons of the\r\n  city of London_; and by this act all persons
        practising the art of\r\n  shaving, are strictly enjoined not to intermeddle
        with that of\r\n  surgery, except what belongs to drawing of teeth. Thus this
        company\r\n  obtained the name of Barber-Surgeons, which they continued to
        enjoy\r\n  till the eighteenth year of the reign of his present Majesty King\r\n
        \ George II. when the Surgeons applying to Parliament to have this union\r\n
        \ dissolved, were formed into a separate company; though the Barbers\r\n  were
        left in possession of the hall and theatre, and were constituted\r\n  a body
        politic, under the name of _the Master, Governors and\r\n  Commonalty of the
        mystery of Barbers of London_.\r\n\r\n  This company has a Master and three
        other Governors, a court of\r\n  Assistants of twenty-four members, and a
        very numerous livery.\r\n\r\nBARBERS HALL, a fine edifice on the west side
        of Monkwell street,\r\n  consisting of a spacious hall room, a court room,
        theatre, library,\r\n  and other commodious offices. The grand entrance from
        Monkwell street\r\n  is enriched with the company\u2019s arms, large fruit,
        and other\r\n  decorations. The court room has a fretwork ceiling, and is
        also\r\n  adorned with the pictures of King Henry VIII. and the court of\r\n
        \ Assistants, in one fine piece; a portrait of King Charles II. and\r\n  other
        paintings. The theatre contains four degrees of cedar seats, one\r\n  above
        another, in an elliptical form, and the roof is an elliptical\r\n  cupola;
        this room is adorned with a bust of King Charles I. the\r\n  figures of the
        seven liberal sciences, and the twelve signs of the\r\n  Zodiac; the skins
        of a man and woman on wooden frames, in imitation of\r\n  Adam and Eve; the
        figure of a man flayed, done after the life, all the\r\n  muscles appearing
        in their due place, and proportion; the skeleton of\r\n  an ostrich; an human
        skeleton, with copper joints, and five other\r\n  skeletons of human bodies.
        But as this furniture was introduced by the\r\n  Surgeons, it is now of no
        use, and the theatre is entirely deserted.\r\n\r\n  This Hall is one of the
        works of that great architect Inigo Jones, and\r\n  is a masterpiece in its
        kind, that elegant simplicity which\r\n  characterises all his works, giving
        the spectator the highest\r\n  satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBARBER\u2019S _alley_,

        from whence fish is sent up in\r\n  boats to London, the town being chiefly
        inhabited by fishermen. The\r\n  parish has been so much enlarged by lands
        recovered from the Thames,\r\n  and the river Rothing, which runs on the west
        side of the town, that\r\n  it has two chapels of ease, one at Ilford, and
        another called New\r\n  chapel, on the side of Epping forest, and the great
        and small tithes\r\n  are computed at above 600_l._ _per annum_. At a small
        distance from\r\n  the town, in the way to Dagenham, stood a large old house,

        by the Thames. It lies\r\n  between Mortlake and Barn Elms, and is seven miles
        from London, and\r\n  five from Kingston.\r\n\r\nBARNET, a market town in
        Hertfordshire, situated in the road to St.\r\n  Alban\u2019s, eleven miles
        from London, on the top of a hill, whence it is\r\n  called High Barnet, and
        also Chipping, or Cheaping Barnet, from King\r\n  Henry the Second\u2019s
        granting the monks of St. Alban\u2019s the privilege of\r\n  holding a market
        here; the word Cheap, or Chepe, being an ancient word\r\n  for a market. As
        this place is a great thoroughfare, it is well\r\n  supplied with inns. The
        church is a chapel of ease to the village of\r\n  East Barnet. Here is a free
        school founded by Q. Elizabeth, and\r\n  endowed partly by that Princess,
        and partly by Alderman Owen, of\r\n  London, whose additional endowment is
        paid by the Fishmongers company,\r\n  who appoint 24 governors, by whom the
        master and usher are chosen to\r\n  teach seven children gratis, and all the
        other children of the parish\r\n  for 5_s_ a quarter. Here is also an almshouse
        founded and endowed by\r\n  James Ravenscroft, Esq; for six widows.\r\n\r\n
        \ This place is remarkable for the decisive battle fought there between\r\n
        \ the houses of York and Lancaster, on Easter day, 1468, in which the\r\n
        \ great Earl of Warwick, stiled _the Setter up, and Puller down of\r\n  Kings_,
        was slain, with many others of the principal nobility. The\r\n  place supposed
        to be the field of battle, is a green spot, a little\r\n  before the meeting
        of the St. Alban\u2019s and Hatfield roads: and here, in\r\n  the year 1740,
        a stone column was erected, on which is inscribed a\r\n  long account of that

        _Church_, situated at the south east corner of\r\n  Bartholomew lane, behind
        the Royal Exchange, was one of the churches\r\n  consumed in the general conflagration
        in 1666, and this structure\r\n  arose in its place. It consists of a very
        irregular body, with a tower\r\n  suited to it, the top of which, instead
        of pinnacles, a spire, or\r\n  turrets, is crowned with arches, supported
        by columns of the\r\n  Corinthian order. It is a rectory, in the gift of the
        Crown, and the\r\n  Rector receives 100_l._ a year in lieu of tithes.\r\n\r\nBARTHOLOMEW
        _lane_, extends from Threadneedle street to Lothbury, and is\r\n  so named

        _the Great_, situated near the east end of Duck lane,\r\n  on the north east
        side of Smithfield, escaped the flames in 1666, and\r\n  is a large plain
        church, with a tower crowned with a turret. It is a\r\n  rectory in the patronage
        of the Earl of Holland, The Rector\u2019s profits,\r\n  besides casualties,
        amount to about 60_l._ _per annum_.\r\n\r\n_St._ BARTHOLOMEW _the Less_, is
        seated on the south east side of\r\n  Smithfield, adjoining to St. Bartholomew\u2019s
        Hospital. It was founded in\r\n  the year 1102, and belonged to the neighbouring
        convent of the same\r\n  name; but as it was not destroyed by the fire in
        1666, it remains in\r\n  the same state it was in before that dreadful calamity.
        It is a low\r\n  building, composed of brick and rough stone plaistered; and
        consists\r\n  of a roofed body with Gothic windows, and a tower with a corner\r\n
        \ turret. This church is a vicarage, in the gift of the Lord Mayor,\r\n  Aldermen,
        and Common Council, who upon receiving the grant of the\r\n  church and hospital,
        covenanted to pay the Vicar 13_l._ 6_s._ 8_d._\r\n  _per annum_, which, with
        an allowance from the hospital, and\r\n  casualties, amounts to about 120_l._
        _per annum_.\r\n\r\n_St._ BARTHOLOMEW\u2019S HOSPITAL, on the south east of
        Smithfield, for the\r\n  cure of the poor, sick and lame, formerly belonged
        to the Priory of\r\n  St. Bartholomew in Smithfield; but both the priory and
        hospital being\r\n  dissolved by K. Henry VIII. that Monarch, in the last
        year of his\r\n  reign, founded the hospital anew, and endowed it with the
        annual\r\n  revenue of 500 marks, upon condition that the city should pay
        the same\r\n  sum, which proposal was readily embraced, and the managers of
        this\r\n  foundation were incorporated by the name of _The Hospital of the\r\n
        \ Mayor, Commonalty and Citizens of London, Governors for the poor,\r\n  called
        Little St. Bartholomew\u2019s, near West Smithfield_. Since that\r\n  time
        the hospital has received prodigious benefactions from great\r\n  numbers
        of charitable persons, by which means not only the poor of\r\n  London and
        Southwark, but the distressed of any other parts of the\r\n  King\u2019s dominions,
        and from foreign countries, are taken in, whether\r\n  sick or maimed, and
        have lodging, food, attendance, and medicines,\r\n  with the advice and assistance
        of some of the best Physicians and\r\n  Surgeons in the kingdom, who belong
        to the hospital, and attend the\r\n  patients as occasion requires; they have
        also matrons and nurses, to\r\n  look after and assist them; and at their
        discharge when cured, some,\r\n  who live at a considerable distance, are
        relieved with money, cloaths,\r\n  and other necessaries, to enable them to
        return to their several\r\n  habitations. Pity it is that so noble and humane
        a foundation should\r\n  want any thing to render it perfect, and that every
        sick person who is\r\n  admitted, except such as have suffered by sudden accidents,
        as the\r\n  fracture or dislocation of a bone, should be obliged to deposit
        or\r\n  give security for the payment of a guinea, in case of death, in order\r\n
        \ to defray the expence of the funeral; for by this some of the poorest\r\n
        \ and most miserable, and consequently the most proper objects, are\r\n  unhappily
        excluded from reaping the benefit they might otherwise\r\n  receive from it:
        but this is also the case of several of the other\r\n  hospitals of this city;
        however many thousands of persons labouring\r\n  under the most dreadful diseases
        and wounds, are annually cured at\r\n  this hospital, and in those of Kent
        street in Southwark, and the Lock\r\n  at Kingsland, both of which are dependent
        on it. Besides all this,\r\n  there are great numbers of out-patients, who
        receive advice and\r\n  medicines gratis.\r\n\r\n  The ancient hospital which
        escaped the fire of London becoming\r\n  ruinous, it was found absolutely
        necessary in the year 1729 to rebuild\r\n  it; a plan for that purpose was
        formed, and a grand edifice erected,\r\n  by subscription, which was designed
        to be only one out of four noble\r\n  detached piles of building, to be afterwards
        raised, about a court or\r\n  area 250 feet in length, and 60 in breadth.\r\n\r\n
        \ The original design is now nearly compleated, and this hospital\r\n  altogether
        forms a very elegant building, or rather buildings, for the\r\n  sides which
        compose the quadrangle do not join at the angles, as is\r\n  usual, but by
        four walls, each having a large gate which admits you\r\n  into the area,
        as may be seen in the print. Here is a staircase\r\n  painted and given by
        Mr. Hogarth, containing two pictures with figures\r\n  large as the life,
        which for truth of colouring and expression may vie\r\n  with any thing of
        its kind in Europe. The subject of the one is the\r\n  Good Samaritan, the
        other the Pool of Bethesda.\r\n\r\nBARTLET\u2019S _buildings_, Holborn.\u2020\r\n\r\nBARTLET\u2019S

        \ _Lords of the_ BEDCHAMBER, fourteen officers of great distinction,\r\n  under
        the Lord Chamberlain; the first of whom is Groom of the Stole.\r\n  They are
        usually persons of the highest quality, and their office is,\r\n  each in
        his turn, to wait one week in the King\u2019s bedchamber, and there\r\n  to
        lie all night on a pallet bed by the King, and to supply the place\r\n  of
        the Groom of the Stole in his absence. They also wait upon the King\r\n  when
        he eats in private; for the cupbearers, carvers, and sewers do\r\n  not then
        wait. The Groom of the Stole has 2000_l._ a year, and the\r\n  rest of the
        Lords of the Bedchamber 1000_l._ a year each. See GROOM OF\r\n  THE STOLE.\r\n\r\n
        \ _Grooms of the_ BEDCHAMBER, eight officers of considerable rank under\r\n
        \ the Lords of the bedchamber, each of whom has a salary of 500_l._ _per\r\n
        \ annum_.\r\n\r\nBEDDINGTON, in Surrey, the seat and manor of the ancient
        family of the\r\n  Carews, is a noble edifice; but the wings are too deep
        for the body of\r\n  the house; for they should either have been placed at
        a greater\r\n  distance, or not have been so long. The court before them is
        fine, as\r\n  is the canal in the park, which lies before this court, and
        has a\r\n  river running through it. All the flat part of the park is taken
        up\r\n  with very fine gardens, which extend in vistas two or three miles.
        The\r\n  orangery is said to be the only one in England that is planted in
        the\r\n  natural ground, and the trees, which are above an hundred years old,\r\n
        \ were brought out of Italy by Sir Francis Carew, Bart. They are,\r\n  however,
        secured in the winter by moveable covers. The pleasure house,\r\n  which was
        also built by Sir Francis, has the famous Spanish Armada\r\n  painted on the
        top of it, and under it is a cold bath. The church is a\r\n  beautiful small
        Gothic pile, built of stone, in the north and south\r\n  isles of which are
        several stalls after the manner of cathedrals: and\r\n  here is also two charity
        schools, one for boys, and the other for\r\n  girls.\r\n\r\nBEDFORD _buildings_,

        it was much frequented on account of\r\n  its neighbourhood to London: but

        many miles beyond the Thames, which is about a mile and\r\n  half distant.

        exhibits to the eye of the delighted spectator, as\r\n  pleasing a landskip
        of the kind as imagination can form. The\r\n  innumerable ships employed in
        the immense trade of London, are beheld\r\n  continually sailing up and down
        the river. On the other side are\r\n  prospects not less beautiful, tho\u2019
        of another kind. This gentleman has\r\n  very judiciously laid out his grounds,
        and made many beautiful vistas.\r\n  The house is but small, tho\u2019 an
        addition has been made of a very noble\r\n  room; this and two others are

        vulgarly called St.\r\n  Bennet, an Italian saint, the founder of the order
        of Benedictine\r\n  monks; and received the additional name of _Fink_ from
        its rebuilder\r\n  Robert Fink. It is situated on the south side of Thread-needle-street.\r\n
        \ The old church being destroyed in the general conflagration in 1666,\r\n
        \ the present edifice was erected in its room. The body is of an\r\n  irregular
        form, enlightened by large arched windows, which reach to\r\n  the roof; this
        is incompassed with a balustrade, and crowned with a\r\n  lantern: a dome
        rises upon the whole extent of the tower, and on its\r\n  top rises a turret.\r\n\r\n
        \ This church is a curacy in the patronage of the Dean and Chapter of\r\n
        \ Windsor, who generally supply it with one of their own Canons. The\r\n  Curate
        receives 100_l._ a year in lieu of tithes.\r\n\r\n_St._ BENNET\u2019S _Gracechurch
        street_, is situated at the south west\r\n  corner of Fenchurch street. The
        old church being much damaged by the\r\n  fire in 1666, was taken down, and
        the present structure erected in its\r\n  place, which is built principally
        of stone, and is a regular,\r\n  convenient, and neat edifice, without the
        expence of columns and\r\n  porticos. It has a handsome balustrade at the
        top, and a very high\r\n  spire of the obelisk kind, the base of which is
        supported by four\r\n  porticos.\r\n\r\n  This church is a rectory in the
        patronage of the Dean and Chapter of\r\n  St. Paul\u2019s; and the parish
        of St. Leonard Eastcheap is annexed to it.\r\n  The Rector receives 140_l._
        a year in lieu of tithes.\r\n\r\n_St._ BENNET\u2019S _Paul\u2019s Wharf_,
        is so called from its being consecrated\r\n  to St. Benedict, and its vicinity
        to that wharf. It is situated at the\r\n  south west corner of St. Bennet\u2019s
        hill, and the old church being\r\n  destroyed by the fire of London in 1666,
        this was erected in its\r\n  place, from a design of Sir Christopher Wren.
        It is a neat structure;\r\n  the body is well proportioned: the tower has
        rustic corners, and its\r\n  turret and small spire are raised from the crown
        of a dome.\r\n\r\n  This church is a rectory, the collation to which is in
        the Dean and\r\n  Chapter of St. Paul\u2019s. The parish of St. Peter Paul\u2019s
        Wharf is united\r\n  to it, and the Rector receives 100_l._ a year in lieu
        of tithes.\r\n\r\n  _St_. BENNET\u2019S _Sherehog_, stood opposite to St.
        Sythe\u2019s lane, in St.\r\n  Pancras lane, and in the ward of Cheap. In
        the year 1323, it went by\r\n  the name of St. Osyth, from its being dedicated
        to a queen and martyr\r\n  of that name; but she was divested of the tutelage
        of this church, by\r\n  Benedict Shorne, a fishmonger of London, who was a
        rebuilder,\r\n  repairer, or benefactor to it; and Shorne his surname, being
        corrupted\r\n  into Shrog, was at last converted into Sherehog. This church
        sharing\r\n  the common fate of the general conflagration in 1666, and not
        being\r\n  rebuilt, the parish was annexed to that of St. Stephen\u2019s Walbrook.\r\n

        _street_, Berwick street.\r\n\r\nBERKHAMSTED, an ancient town in Hertfordshire,
        situated 30 miles to the\r\n  N. W. of London. It was anciently a Roman town,
        and here some of the\r\n  Saxon kings kept their court. William the Conqueror
        here swore to the\r\n  nobility to preserve the laws made by his predecessors;
        and here Henry\r\n  II. kept his court, and granted the town all the laws
        and liberties it\r\n  had enjoyed under Edward the Confessor. It was a borough
        in the reign\r\n  of Henry III. and James I. to whose children this place
        was a nursery,\r\n  made it a corporation, by the name of the Bailiff and
        Burgesses of\r\n  Berkhamsted St. Peter; the Burgesses to be twelve, to chuse
        a\r\n  Recorder, and Town Clerk, to have a prison, _&c._ but in the next\r\n
        \ reign it was so impoverished by the civil wars, that the government\r\n
        \ was dropp\u2019d, and has not been since renewed. Its market is also much\r\n
        \ decayed. The town, though situated on the south side of a marsh,\r\n  extends
        itself far in a broad street, and handsome buildings, and is\r\n  pleasantly
        surrounded with high and hard ground, full of pastures,\r\n  hedgerows, and
        arable land. What remains of the castle, which is but\r\n  one third of it,
        was not long ago the seat of the Careys, and is now\r\n  the seat of the family
        of the Ropers. Here is a spacious church\r\n  dedicated to St. Peter, which
        has eleven of the Apostles on its\r\n  pillars, with a sentence of the creed
        on each, and on the twelfth\r\n  pillar is St. George killing the dragon.
        The other public buildings\r\n  are, a free school, which is a handsome brick
        structure, well endowed,\r\n  the King being patron, and the Warden of All
        Souls College in Oxford,\r\n  Visitor; and a handsome almshouse, built and
        endowed by Mr. John Sayer\r\n  and his wife, who gave 1300_l._ for that purpose.\r\n\r\nBERKLEY
        SQUARE, near Hyde Park road, contains about three acres, and is\r\n  well
        built on the north, east and west sides.\r\n\r\n  The following is an account
        of the choice and valuable collection of\r\n  pictures and prints of John
        Barnard, Esq; at his house in Berkley\r\n  square.\r\n\r\n  A holy family,
        by Parmegiano, well preserved, and the characters very\r\n  fine. It was out
        of the Count de Platembourg\u2019s collection at\r\n  Amsterdam.\r\n\r\n  A
        crucifixion, by Paulo Veronese, about three feet high; there is a\r\n  fine
        group of figures at bottom, and the figures on the cross are\r\n  remarkably
        well drawn.\r\n\r\n  Christ calling to Zaccheus; and the Angel appearing to
        St. John in the\r\n  wilderness; both by Paulo Veronese, in his finest manner
        and highest\r\n  colouring.\r\n\r\n  A pr\xE6sepe, or nativity, by Jacomo
        Bassan; the light comes from the\r\n  child, and has a surprizing effect,
        being in his highest colouring.\r\n  These three last are upright narrow pictures,
        oval at top, and were\r\n  originally designed for some elegant little chapel.\r\n\r\n
        \ Christ led to be crucified, by the same master; the colouring is the\r\n
        \ richest; and the expression is much finer than one often sees of\r\n  Bassan.\r\n\r\n
        \ Adam ploughing and Eve spinning, by Domenico Fetti: this picture is\r\n
        \ finely coloured, and the character of Eve is prettier than can well be\r\n
        \ expressed; it was in the collection of Monsieur Biberon at Paris, and\r\n
        \ Monsieur Crozat mentions it in his work, along with two others of the\r\n
        \ same subject, one of which belongs to the King of France.\r\n\r\n  A holy
        family, with a little St. John presenting a cross, by Guido.\r\n  This picture,
        which is but fifteen inches high, may be truly said to\r\n  be in his very
        finest manner; the characters of the Virgin and St.\r\n  Joseph are inexpressibly
        fine, and it is in the best preservation. It\r\n  was in the Duke de Tallard\u2019s
        collection.\r\n\r\n  The martyrdom of a female saint, by Correggio. This picture
        came out\r\n  of the same collection as the last, and is much of the same
        size; it\r\n  is in his first manner, but yet visibly of his hand; the colouring
        and\r\n  some of the characters are fine. The Duke of Tallard had it out of
        the\r\n  collection of Monsieur Crozat, where it was always esteemed a true\r\n
        \ picture of Correggio.\r\n\r\n  A holy family, with a little St. John presenting
        a dish of fruit, by\r\n  Simone da Pesaro, commonly called Cantarini, who
        was the best disciple\r\n  of Guido. The figures are half length as big as
        life. True pictures of\r\n  this master are very scarce in England, and this
        is one of his best,\r\n  and in the highest preservation.\r\n\r\n  The Virgin
        with the child in her lap, half length, as big as life, by\r\n  Vandyck. The
        character of the Virgin is as sweet, and the colouring as\r\n  fine, as any
        thing of this master\u2019s painting. This was out of the\r\n  collection
        of Monsieur Biberon, and there is an old print of this\r\n  picture.\r\n\r\n
        \ A holy family, by the same master. This is the small picture, but the\r\n
        \ characters of the Virgin and child, and the sweetness and mellowness\r\n
        \ of the colouring, are at least equal to the large one. There is a\r\n  print
        of this by Bolswert.\r\n\r\n  A head of St. Peter, with a fish in his hand,
        by Spagnoletto. The\r\n  expression and force in this picture are extremely
        great. There is a\r\n  mezzotinto print engraved after it by Mr. MacArdell.\r\n\r\n
        \ Pharoah and his host drowned in the Red sea, about five feet wide, by\r\n
        \ Valerio Castelli. The character of Moses is very great, and the\r\n  colouring
        throughout is remarkably fine.\r\n\r\n  The conversion of St. Paul, by Luca
        Jordano, with many figures and\r\n  horsemen, about six feet wide. This is
        one of his best, in the free\r\n  and spirited style, for which he was most
        famous.\r\n\r\n  A battle, by the same master, not quite so large. The composition
        in\r\n  this picture is better, and the figures seem more alive and in motion,\r\n
        \ than in almost any battle pieces to be met with.\r\n\r\n  Tobit burying
        the dead, by Benedetto Castiglione, in the style of\r\n  Nicola Poussin, which
        master (in his latter time) he particularly\r\n  studied and imitated; and
        he succeeded therein so well, in this\r\n  picture, both in the composition
        and drawing, that was not his name\r\n  upon it, several of the best judges
        have declared, they should not\r\n  only have taken it for a true picture
        of that master, but also for a\r\n  very fine one of him.\r\n\r\n  A landskip,
        by Claude Lorrain, near four feet wide; the subject is a\r\n  warm evening;
        it is in the highest preservation, not in the least\r\n  turned black, and
        in his very finest taste and manner of painting: the\r\n  keeping, and that
        harmony and tenderness of tints, for which that\r\n  master was so famous,
        are remarkably conspicuous in this picture, and\r\n  the figures, which are
        but few, are much better than one generally\r\n  sees in his works.\r\n\r\n
        \ A pr\xE6sepe, by Pietro da Cortona: the composition and the harmony of\r\n
        \ colours in this picture are very fine.\r\n\r\n  The entombing of Christ,
        by Federico Barocci: the dead body is rather\r\n  disagreeable, but some of
        the characters are very fine. This was out\r\n  of the Duke D\u2019Auvergne\u2019s
        collection at Paris.\r\n\r\n  The adoration of the Magi, by Rubens: this is
        only a sketch for a\r\n  large picture, yet it is so finished, that at a proper
        distance the\r\n  characters are as expressive, and the colouring as rich
        as in a\r\n  finish\u2019d picture.\r\n\r\n  St. Thomas, who disbelieves putting
        his finger in the wound in\r\n  Christ\u2019s side, by Michael Angelo Caravaggio.
        This is also a sketch,\r\n  but the dignity in the characters, and the fine
        large folds of\r\n  drapery, shew it to be the work of a great master. Mr.
        Barnard has a\r\n  print of this picture etch\u2019d by the master himself,
        which is extremely\r\n  scarce.\r\n\r\n  The stoning of St. Stephen, by Filippo
        Lauri. Though the figures in\r\n  this picture are rather larger than those
        which are in his very best\r\n  manner, yet they are finely drawn, and the
        gaiety and beauty of the\r\n  colouring, together with the fine keeping observed
        in the distant\r\n  figures, make it a very pleasing and fine picture.\r\n\r\n
        \ Christ\u2019s agony in the garden, by the same master. The figures in this\r\n
        \ are smaller than in the preceding; and the fine characters, and\r\n  correctness
        of drawing of the figures, joined to the beautiful\r\n  colouring, have always
        made this picture, though a very small one,\r\n  esteemed by the greatest
        judges as one of his best.\r\n\r\n  The same subject in a round, about a foot
        diameter, by Carlo Maratti;\r\n  the angels heads are fine, and the colouring
        pleasing. This picture\r\n  belonged to Mr. Jarvis the painter, who had a
        companion to it by the\r\n  same hand, the subject a dead Christ; he valued
        them very highly.\r\n\r\n  A holy family, by the same master, about one foot
        seven inches high;\r\n  this is painted in his best time and finest colouring.\r\n\r\n
        \ A Silence, by Nicolo Poussin: the subject a landskip, the evening, in\r\n
        \ which a little boy is running away with a Satyr\u2019s musical instrument\r\n
        \ as he lies asleep; other figures are lying and leaning in a reposed\r\n
        \ manner. Though this picture is only about seventeen inches wide, and\r\n
        \ the figures but small, yet they are as genteel, and as correctly\r\n  drawn,
        as in any of his finest pictures.\r\n\r\n  The woman taken in adultery, by
        Sebastian Ricci. The greatness of the\r\n  design the dignity and propriety
        of the characters, particularly the\r\n  woman, and the harmony of the colours,
        shew him to be (tho\u2019 a modern\r\n  master) equal to most of the greatest
        that went before him.\r\n\r\n  Two misers counting and setting down their
        money; the same subject,\r\n  but with some variation as that at Windsor,
        by Quintin Matsys of\r\n  Antwerp, who repeated this picture several times.\r\n\r\n
        \ An old man\u2019s head with a ruff, painted by Rembrant. It is thought to\r\n
        \ be the portrait of Ephraim Bonus the Physician, as it bears a great\r\n
        \ resemblance to the print of him engraved by Rembrant himself, but in\r\n
        \ the picture he is much older. The light and shade in this picture is\r\n
        \ extremely fine. Mr. Houston, an excellent engraver in mezzotinto, has\r\n
        \ engraved a very fine print after this picture.\r\n\r\n  A fine landskip
        with Tobit and the Angel, near three feet wide, by the\r\n  same master; the
        effect of colours in this picture is surprising.\r\n\r\n  A Magdalene\u2019s
        head, by Guido.\r\n\r\n  An historical subject, a woman and three children,
        _&c._ by Solimene.\r\n  This is better coloured, and more finished, than one
        generally sees of\r\n  this master.\r\n\r\n  Angels holding a mitre over St.
        Ambrose, a finished sketch for a large\r\n  picture, by the same master. The
        character of St. Ambrose is very\r\n  fine, and the draperies are in a great
        style of painting.\r\n\r\n  Susannah and the Elders, by Le Moine. The colouring
        of the woman, who\r\n  is near naked, is very fine, and the composition and
        the landskip are\r\n  very agreeable.\r\n\r\n  A little boy and girl naked
        in a landskip of a garden, by Albano, in\r\n  his richest colouring.\r\n\r\n
        \ A battle, by Bourgognone, about two feet wide; this is clearer and\r\n  better
        coloured than most of his pictures usually are.\r\n\r\n  Two landskips, by
        Gaspar Poussin, about two feet two inches wide each.\r\n  They are in his
        finest green manner, and extremely well preserved.\r\n\r\n  Another landskip,
        by the same master, a little larger but upright, and\r\n  also in his richest
        and best manner.\r\n\r\n  A landskip with rocks, and a man lying reading,
        by Salvator Rosa,\r\n  about two feet two inches wide. This is one of those
        pictures that\r\n  were engraved and published by direction of Mr. Pond some
        years ago:\r\n  it belonged then to Mr. Kent.\r\n\r\n  A landskip, its companion,
        by Bartolomeo, a disciple of the above\r\n  master. The figures and water
        in this picture are remarkably fine.\r\n\r\n  A landskip, a warm evening,
        about the same size, by Jean Asselin,\r\n  commonly called Crabacci, with
        cattle in the water by Berchem in his\r\n  finest manner. Mr. Major, an engraver
        of great merit, has made a very\r\n  capital print from this picture.\r\n\r\n
        \ A landskip with cattle and figures, by Cuyp, its companion. The\r\n  sun-shine,
        for which this master is so famous, is particularly fine in\r\n  this picture.\r\n\r\n
        \ Venus and Adonis with Cupids, by Van Baelen, in a landskip about the\r\n
        \ same size as the above, by Velvet Brughell, who has introduced dogs,\r\n
        \ _&c._ painted with the utmost life and spirit. This is as fine a\r\n  coloured
        picture as can possibly be met with.\r\n\r\n  A landskip about the same size,
        with a flock of sheep, _&c._ by\r\n  Francesco Mille. The composition is fine,
        and this is one of his\r\n  richest pictures.\r\n\r\n  A piece of ruins, by
        Viviano, about the same size.\r\n\r\n  A piece of ruins, by Ghisolfi, with
        a man sitting by the side of the\r\n  Tiber.\r\n\r\n  A sea calm with English
        yachts, by William Vandevelde. The keeping,\r\n  the figures, and the water,
        are uncommonly fine in this picture.\r\n\r\n  A canal with boats on it, and
        a bridge at the end, with buildings on\r\n  each side, by Canaletti. This
        picture, for the fineness of the water,\r\n  and the justness of the perspective,
        is allowed to be one of the very\r\n  finest of this master.\r\n\r\n  A landskip
        with figures, fishing, &c. by Zuccharelli, about 2 feet 9\r\n  inches wide.
        This picture from the fineness of the figures, and the\r\n  uncommon richness
        of the colouring, has been always deemed at least\r\n  equal to any thing
        this great master ever painted.\r\n\r\n  A holy family, with a little St.
        John sitting on a lamb, by\r\n  Scarcellini de Ferrara, after a design of
        Augustine Caracci; it is a\r\n  small picture, but the characters and colouring
        are remarkably sweet\r\n  in it.\r\n\r\n  A very masterly sketch of the miraculous
        cross of St. Antonio de\r\n  Padua, by Seb. Ricci. This at a little distance,
        has all the effect of\r\n  a finish\u2019d picture.\r\n\r\n  Christ and the
        two disciples at Emaus, by Elsheimer. The story is\r\n  finely told, and there
        is great expression in the figures: this\r\n  picture is a curiosity, not
        only from the great scarceness of the\r\n  works of this master, but there
        are in it two different candle lights,\r\n  and a moon light, which have an
        uncommon, and yet pleasing effect.\r\n\r\n  The Virgin supporting a dead Christ,
        by Lubin Baugin, called in\r\n  France, Le Petit Guide, from his happy manner
        of imitating the stile\r\n  of that great master, of which this little picture,
        among others, is a\r\n  proof: this was out of the Duke de Tallard\u2019s
        collection.\r\n\r\n  A sea monster swimming away with a woman, by Albert Durer,
        who has\r\n  engraved a print of the same subject: this is extremely well\r\n
        \ preserved, and there is a much better keeping observed in it than is\r\n
        \ usual in pictures of that age.\r\n\r\n  A camelion with a thistle and flies,
        most exquisitely painted after\r\n  the life, by Van Aelst.\r\n\r\n  A group
        of various flowers with insects in a glass of water, by a\r\n  master who
        has mark\u2019d the picture with [Albrecht Durer\u2019s mark] This in\r\n
        \ point of finishing, is perhaps carried as high as art, colours, and\r\n
        \ the finest pointed pencils can possibly arrive.\r\n\r\n  A man sitting smoaking,
        and other back figures, by David Teniers. This\r\n  is in his finest stile,
        both for colouring and expression.\r\n\r\n  Two men with a little dog going
        to enter a cottage; a smaller picture\r\n  by the same master. Mr. Major has
        engraved a print from this, and\r\n  call\u2019d it the Friendly Invitation.\r\n\r\n
        \ There are other smaller pictures, good in their kind, such as the\r\n  Virgin
        and Child, by Rottenhammer, highly finished and coloured.\r\n\r\n  The same
        subject, the school of Caracci, if not of him.\r\n\r\n  The Virgin and Child
        with a bird, and a little St. John, by Sebastian\r\n  Bourdon, richer coloured
        than common of this master.\r\n\r\n  A holy family and St. Catherine, by Schidoni.\r\n\r\n
        \ An angel drawing an arrow from the side of St. Sebastian, finely\r\n  coloured
        by Gerrard Seghers.\r\n\r\n  Alpheus and Arethusa, Glaucus and Scylla, by
        Filippo Lauri, in his\r\n  best manner.\r\n\r\n  A ship on fire, by Vandevelde:
        the effect surprizingly fine.\r\n\r\n  A landskip, by Wynants, highly finish\u2019d,
        &c.\r\n\r\n  The same Gentleman has also a collection of about twelve thousand\r\n
        \ prints, engraved and etched by the most celebrated masters of the\r\n  three
        last centuries, much the greatest part of which are not only in\r\n  the highest
        preservation, but also of the finest impressions; and of\r\n  many of the
        matters, there are either all, or very near the whole\r\n  work; they are
        contained in about 50 large volumes, besides above 60\r\n  volumes in sculpture
        and architecture. The principal part of this\r\n  collection of prints are
        engraved and etched by Andrea Mantegna, Marco\r\n  Antonio Raimondi, Ugo da

        masters.\r\n\r\nBERKLEY _street_, Hyde park road; thus called from its being
        near the\r\n  Lord Berkley of Stratton\u2019s mansion house.\r\n\r\nBERMEETER\u2019S
        ALMSHOUSE, in St. John street Bethnal green, was founded by\r\n  Mr. Bermeeter,
        for six poor women, and by him endowed with 30_l._ _per\r\n  annum_.\r\n\r\nBERMONDSEY
        SCHOOL, was founded in the year 1718, by Mr. Josiah Bacon,\r\n  who bequeatheth
        the sum of 700_l._ for purchasing land, and erecting a\r\n  school upon it,
        which he endowed with 150_l._ a year, for educating\r\n  sixty poor children
        of the parish of St. Mary Bermondsey street,\r\n  called by corruption Barnaby
        street. See _St._ MARY MAGDALEN\u2019S\r\n  BERMONDSEY.\r\n\r\n  The district
        of Bermondsey appears in William the Conqueror\u2019s survey\r\n  to have
        been a royal manor, in which were twenty five husbandmen, and\r\n  twenty-three
        cottagers. _Maitland._\r\n\r\nBERNARD\u2019S or BARNARD\u2019S INN, situated

        Soho.\r\n\r\nBETHLEHEM _court_, Old Bethlehem.\u2020\r\n\r\nBETHLEM, or BEDLAM
        HOSPITAL, originally a priory, was founded in the\r\n  year 1247, by Simon
        Fitzroy, of London, or according to Stow, Simon\r\n  Fitz Mary, Sheriff of
        London, on the east side of the place now called\r\n  the quarters of Moorfields,
        and of the burial ground of Old Bethlem.\r\n  This priory consisted of brothers
        and sisters, who wore a star upon\r\n  their copes and mantles, probably in
        commemoration of the star that\r\n  guided the wisemen in their visit to our
        Saviour at his birth; and\r\n  these monks were to receive the Bishop and
        the Canons of Bethlehem,\r\n  whenever they should come to England. But King
        Henry VIII. giving this\r\n  house to the city of London, it was converted
        into an hospital for the\r\n  cure of lunatics; but not without a certain
        weekly expence, paid\r\n  either by their relations or the parish.\r\n\r\n
        \ This hospital being, however, in an incommodious situation, and\r\n  becoming
        both ruinous, and unable to receive and entertain the great\r\n  number of
        distracted persons, whose friends sued for their admission,\r\n  the Lord
        Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council, granted the Governors a\r\n  piece of
        ground along the south side of the lower quarters of\r\n  Moorfields, upon
        which the foundation of the present hospital was laid\r\n  in April 1675,
        and notwithstanding its being the most magnificent\r\n  edifice of its kind
        in Europe, was only fifteen months in erecting, as\r\n  appears by an inscription
        on its front.\r\n\r\n  This noble edifice is 540 feet in length, and 40 feet
        in breadth, and\r\n  is finely situated. The middle and ends, which project
        a little, are\r\n  adorned with pilasters, entablatures, foliages, and other
        ornaments,\r\n  and rising above the rest of the building, have each a flat
        roof with\r\n  a handsome balustrade of stone, in the center of which is an
        elegant\r\n  turret. That in the middle is adorned with a clock, and three
        dials, a\r\n  gilt ball, and a vane on the top.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:
        S. Wale del.   B. Green sculp. _Bethlem._]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: S.
        Wale del.   B. Green sculp. _London Bridge._]\r\n\r\n\r\n  This building upon
        the whole shews more the good intentions, than the\r\n  good taste of the
        founders of this charity, the style of architecture\r\n  being very improper
        for an hospital for madmen. Simplicity and\r\n  regularity was all that should
        have been aimed at, and if there was a\r\n  necessity for pilasters, those
        of the Tuscan order would have suited\r\n  the design much better than Corinthian;
        but without regarding the\r\n  application, the middle pavilion, which is
        elegant, should have\r\n  certainly been larger and more principal. The entrance
        is grand, and\r\n  the figures on the piers, one representing raving, and
        the other\r\n  melancholy madness, are finely expressed, and do honour to
        their\r\n  author Mr. Cibber, father of the late Poet Laureat. Since the first\r\n
        \ erecting of this edifice, two wings have been added, in order to\r\n  contain
        a number of incurables. And before this fabric is a handsome\r\n  wall 680
        feet in length, which, like the structure itself, is built\r\n  with brick
        and stone. It incloses a range of gardens neatly adorned\r\n  with walks of
        broad stone, grass plats and trees, wherein those of the\r\n  lunatics who
        are well enough to be suffered to go about, are allowed\r\n  to walk there
        and enjoy the benefit of the fresh air. In the middle of\r\n  this wall is
        a large pair of fine iron gates, and by them a small\r\n  entrance for the
        admission of those who come out of curiosity to visit\r\n  this hospital;
        on each side towards the top of these gates are placed\r\n  the two statues,
        in the manner represented in the print.\r\n\r\n  The expence of erecting this
        edifice, besides that of building the\r\n  wings, amounted to near 17,000_l._\r\n\r\n
        \ The inside chiefly consists of two galleries one over the other, which\r\n
        \ cross the wings, and are 193 yards long, thirteen feet high, and\r\n  sixteen
        feet broad; without including the cells for the patients,\r\n  which are twelve
        feet deep. These galleries are divided in the middle\r\n  by two iron grates,
        by which means all the men are placed at one end\r\n  of the house, and all
        the women at the other, and in each gallery\r\n  servants lie, to be ready
        at hand on all occasions. In the middle of\r\n  the upper gallery is a large
        spacious room, where the Governors, and,\r\n  in the lower, where the weekly
        Committee meet, and the Physician\r\n  prescribes for the patients; besides,
        above there are convenient\r\n  apartments for the steward of the house, the
        porter, matron, nurse and\r\n  servants; and below stairs all necessary offices
        for keeping and\r\n  dressing the provisions; for washing, and other necessary
        offices\r\n  belonging to so large a family; and also a bathing place for
        the\r\n  patients, so contrived, as to be an hot or cold bath, as occasion\r\n
        \ requires.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _S. Wale delin._ _C. Grignion sc._
        _Figures on Bethlem\r\n  Gate_]\r\n\r\n\r\n  There are generally above 200
        lunatics maintained in this hospital,\r\n  each of whom has a small room or
        cell to himself, where he is locked\r\n  up on nights, and in this room is
        a place for a bed; but where the\r\n  patients are so senseless as not to
        be fit to make use of one, they\r\n  are every day provided with fresh clean
        straw. Those are judged the\r\n  fittest objects that are raving and furious,
        and yet capable of cure.\r\n\r\n  As to the method of admitting them, they
        are brought on Saturday, when\r\n  the Committee meets, to be viewed by them
        and the Physician; and if a\r\n  person be judged a fit object, a warrant
        is drawn up for his admission\r\n  by the clerk of the hospital, to be signed
        by the President, or, in\r\n  his absence, by the Treasurer. Those who put
        in the patient are\r\n  obliged to give a bond, signed by two persons, to
        take him away when\r\n  discharged, or if he dies, to be at the expence of
        burying him. Their\r\n  friends, who put them in, are obliged to provide them
        with cloaths;\r\n  but there is a wardrobe from whence they are supplied,
        when neglected\r\n  by those friends: for though, when raving and furious,
        they suffer but\r\n  little from the weather; yet in their intervals, they
        frequently\r\n  contract other distempers, care of which is also taken, as
        well as of\r\n  their lunacy, whether those distempers be external or internal;
        and\r\n  though formerly every patient paid 5_s._ a week, they now not only
        pay\r\n  nothing, but after their recovery and leaving the hospital, are\r\n
        \ furnished with medicines to prevent a relapse. When a patient is\r\n  cured,
        he is called before a Committee of the Governors and\r\n  Physicians, who
        examine him, and being found fit to be discharged, the\r\n  Physician gives
        a certificate to that purpose, and then the steward of\r\n  the house takes
        care to have him delivered to his friends.\r\n\r\n  The hospitals of Bethlem
        and Bridewell being made one corporation,\r\n  they have the same President,
        Treasurer, Governors, Clerk, Physician,\r\n  Surgeon, and Apothecary; yet
        each hospital has its proper steward and\r\n  inferior officers, and a particular
        committee is chosen out of the\r\n  Governors for each. Out of that appointed
        for Bethlem, there are six\r\n  who meet every Saturday, to examine the steward\u2019s

        belonging to this\r\n  hospital.\r\n\r\nBETHNAL GREEN, a village near Mile
        End, and lately one of the hamlets of\r\n  Stepney, from which parish it was
        separated by an act of parliament in\r\n  the 13th year of his present Majesty\u2019s
        reign. The old Roman way from\r\n  London led thro\u2019 this hamlet, and
        joining the military way from the\r\n  west, passed with it to Lea Ferry at
        Old Ford. Within this hamlet,\r\n  Bonner, Bishop of London, had a palace,
        and the Trinity House have a\r\n  hospital for twenty-eight decayed seamen,
        who have been masters of\r\n  ships or pilots, or their widows. See TRINITY
        HOSPITAL.\r\n\r\n  The church built pursuant to the above act, is placed at
        the north\r\n  east corner of Hare street, Spitalfields, and is a neat, commodious\r\n
        \ edifice, built with brick coped and coined with freestone; and the\r\n  tower,
        which is not high, is of the same materials. It is remarkable,\r\n  that though
        the village of itself is small, yet as part of\r\n  Spitalfields anciently
        belonged to that hamlet, this parish contains\r\n  1800 houses, and the parishioners
        are computed to amount to above\r\n  15000.\r\n\r\nBETT\u2019S _alley_, Anchor

        St. Mary Ax. Here was once a very large house with several\r\n  courts and
        gardens, which belonging to the Abbot of Bury in Suffolk,\r\n  was called
        Bury\u2019s Marks, corruptly Bevis Marks. This house being\r\n  demolished,

        _yard_, Billiter lane.\r\n\r\nBILLINGSGATE, a great fish market in Thames
        street; which is only a\r\n  large water-gate, port, or harbour, for small
        vessels, laden with\r\n  fish, oranges, lemons, Spanish onions, and in summer,
        with Kentish\r\n  cherries; here the Gravesend boats wait to take in their
        fare; and\r\n  here the woodmongers and coalmen meet at about eight or nine
        o\u2019clock\r\n  every morning, this being a kind of exchange for those concerned
        in\r\n  the coal trade.\r\n\r\n  Billingsgate is however most famous for being
        the greatest fish market\r\n  in England, and the only port for fish in London,
        which has occasioned\r\n  several acts of parliament, to prevent the fishmongers
        monopolizing\r\n  that considerable article of food. By these acts it is made
        lawful for\r\n  any person to buy fish in that market, and to sell it again
        in any\r\n  other market or place in the city of London, or elsewhere, by
        retail;\r\n  but no fishmonger, or other person, is to engross or buy more
        than\r\n  shall be for his own sale or use, on pain of forfeiting 20_l._ for\r\n
        \ every such offence, and no fishmonger, or other person, is to expose\r\n
        \ to sale any fish at Billingsgate by retail that was before bought in\r\n
        \ the same market.\r\n\r\nBILLINGSGATE _dock_, Thames street.\r\n\r\nBILLINGSGATE
        _ward_, is situated on the side of the Thames, and is\r\n  therefore bounded
        by that river on the south; as it is on the east by\r\n  Tower street ward,
        on the west by Bridge ward, and on the north by\r\n  Langbourn ward. It contains
        a part of Thames street, and Little\r\n  Eastcheap, which lie in the same
        direction, and those leading from one\r\n  of those streets to the other,
        as St. Mary at hill, Love lane,\r\n  Botolph\u2019s lane, Pudding lane, and
        on the other side of Little\r\n  Eastcheap, a considerable part of Rood lane,
        and Philpot lane. The\r\n  most remarkable buildings are the churches of St.
        Mary at hill, St.\r\n  Margaret Pattens, and St. George, Botolph lane; Butchers
        hall, and the\r\n  King\u2019s weigh-house.\r\n\r\n  This ward is governed
        by an Alderman, and ten Common Council men, one\r\n  of whom is Deputy, eleven
        constables, six scavengers, fourteen\r\n  wardmote inquestmen, and a beadle.\r\n\r\n

        _yard_, Charles street, Grosvenor square.\r\n\r\nBISHOPSGATE, is situated
        1440 feet north west of Aldgate. Mr. Strype\r\n  imagines that it was erected
        by Erkenwald Bishop of London about the\r\n  year 675, a conjecture founded
        only on the effigies of two Bishops\r\n  wherewith this gate was formerly
        adorned, and from which it might take\r\n  its name: but it is probable that
        it was not erected so early, since\r\n  Mr. Stow could not find it mentioned
        before the year 1210.\r\n\r\n  In the reign of King Henry III. the Anseatic
        company residing in this\r\n  city, in consideration of several privileges
        granted them, obliged\r\n  themselves and their successors, not only to keep
        this gate in repair,\r\n  but to defend it, whenever it should be attacked
        by an enemy: and by\r\n  this company it was rebuilt in a beautiful manner
        in the year 1479. On\r\n  the south side over the gateway, was placed a stone
        image of a Bishop\r\n  with a mitre on his head; he had a long beard, eyes
        sunk, and an old\r\n  mortified face, and was supposed to present St. Erkenwald.
        On the\r\n  north side was another Bishop with a smooth face, reaching out
        his\r\n  right hand to bestow his benedictions, and holding a crosier in his\r\n
        \ left, who is thought to have been the courtly Bishop William the\r\n  Norman:
        this last was accompanied by two other figures in stone,\r\n  supposed to
        be King Alfred, and his son Eldred Earl of Mercia. The\r\n  present structure
        is a plain neat edifice erected in 1735. On the top\r\n  over the gateway,
        which is very lofty, is the city arms supported by\r\n  dragons; and on each
        side of the gate is a postern for the convenience\r\n  of foot passengers.\r\n\r\nBISHOPSGATE
        _street_ extends from Cornhill, thro\u2019 the gate, to Norton\r\n  Falgate,
        that part between the gate and Cornhill being called\r\n  Bishopsgate street
        within, and all without the gate, Bishopsgate\r\n  street without.\r\n\r\nBISHOPSGATE
        _ward_, which takes its name from the gate, that stands\r\n  almost in its
        center, is bounded on the south by Langbourn ward; on\r\n  the west by Broad
        street ward; and Moorfields on the east by Aldgate\r\n  ward, Portsoken ward,
        and part of the Tower liberty; and on the north\r\n  by Shoreditch: thus this
        ward extends from the bars near Spital\r\n  square, on both sides of the way,
        (including near half of Houndsditch)\r\n  as far as the pump at the corner
        of St. Martin\u2019s Outwich; and winds by\r\n  the west corner of Leadenhall,
        down Gracechurch street, to the south\r\n  west corner of Fenchurch street.
        The principal places in this ward\r\n  are, the parish churches of St. Botolph
        without Bishopsgate, St.\r\n  Ethelburga\u2019s, and Great St. Helen\u2019s;
        Leatherfellers hall, Gresham\r\n  college, and the London Workhouse.\r\n\r\n
        \ This ward is under the government of an Alderman and two Deputies, one\r\n
        \ within, and the other without the gate, six Common Council men,\r\n  thirteen
        wardmote inquest men, seven constables, seven scavengers, and\r\n  a beadle.

        FRIARS, near Fleet ditch, was a monastery of that order, otherwise\r\n  called
        Preaching Friars. This monastery was erected by Robert Kilwarby\r\n  Archbishop
        of Canterbury, about the year 1276, who also built the\r\n  church of Black
        Friars, to which King Edward I. and Queen Eleanor were\r\n  great benefactors,
        and even the reputed founders. This church was\r\n  large and richly furnished
        with ornaments. In the monastery several\r\n  parliaments were held, and the
        Emperor Charles V. who was also King of\r\n  Spain, lodged there in the year
        1522. There the ancient Kings had\r\n  their records and charters kept, as
        well as at the Tower: and, tho\u2019\r\n  this monastery was dissolved with
        the rest by King Henry VIII. yet in\r\n  the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Black
        Friars was inhabited by many\r\n  noblemen and gentlemen; parliaments still
        continued to be often held\r\n  there, and being a place of refuge, malefactors
        frequently took\r\n  shelter in its liberties, and the inhabitants were free
        from arrests:\r\n  but these pernicious privileges have been many years lost;
        and as it\r\n  has been lately made part of the ward of Faringdon within,
        the\r\n  shopkeepers and tradesmen are obliged to be free of the city; two\r\n
        \ Common Council men are annually elected out of it, and added to the\r\n
        \ number that used to serve this ward.\r\n\r\nBLACK FRIARS _bridge_. The Lord
        Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council of\r\n  this city, have been empowered
        by a late act, to build a bridge cross\r\n  the Thames from Black Friars to
        the opposite side in the county of\r\n  Surrey; to fill up the channel of
        Bridewell dock, or Fleet ditch, and\r\n  to purchase and pull down such buildings
        as shall be thought proper\r\n  for forming and widening streets and avenues.
        This bridge is to have a\r\n  free and open passage thro\u2019 the arches
        of 750 feet at least within the\r\n  banks of the river. A sufficient number
        of glass lamps are to be fixed\r\n  on proper parts of it, to burn from sun
        setting to sun rising; and a\r\n  number of watchmen placed for the security
        of passengers.\r\n\r\n  For the erecting and support of this work, when finished,
        they are to\r\n  receive as toll, any sum they shall direct, not exceeding
        the\r\n  following rates:\r\n\r\n  For every coach, chariot, berlin, chaise,
        chair or calash, drawn by\r\n  six horses, 2_s._\r\n\r\nDrawn by four horses,
        1_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nDrawn by less than four, 1_s._\r\n\r\nFor every waggon,
        wain, cart or car, drawn by four or more horses, or\r\n  other beasts, 1_s._\r\n\r\nFor
        either of the same carriages drawn by less than four horses, &c.\r\n  6_d._\r\n\r\nFor
        every horse, mule or ass, laden or unladen, and not drawing, 1_d._\r\n\r\nFor
        every foot passenger on Sunday, 1_d._\r\n\r\nAnd every other day \xBDd.\r\n\r\nUpon
        the credit of these tolls, the Lord Mayor and Common Council are\r\nimpowered
        to raise any sums of money not exceeding 30,000_l._ in one\r\nyear, till they
        have raised 160,000_l._ in the whole, which they are not\r\nto exceed.\r\n\r\nBLACK
        FRIARS _school_, was founded by Peter Joy, Esq; in the year 1716,\r\n  who
        also endowed it with 160_l._ 17_s._ 3_d._ _per annum_, for\r\n  cloathing
        and instructing forty boys and thirty girls, in reading,\r\n  writing and
        accounts. This school he left in trust with the Governors\r\n  of Sion College,
        who allow the master 40_l._ and the mistress 30_l._ a\r\n  year.\r\n\r\nBLACK
        FRIARS _stairs_, near Fleet ditch.\r\n\r\nBLACKHEATH, a large plain on the
        south of Greenwich, on which Watt\r\n  Tyler, the Kentish rebel, mustered
        100,000 men. In this place, which\r\n  is admired for the fineness of its
        situation, and its excellent air,\r\n  is a noble house built by Sir Gregory
        Page, Bart. a view of which we\r\n  have here given.\r\n\r\n  This is a very
        magnificent edifice, built in the modern taste,\r\n  consisting of a basement
        state and attick story. The wings contain the\r\n  offices and stables, which
        are joined to the body of the house by a\r\n  colonade. It stands in the midst
        of a park with a large piece of water\r\n  before it. The back front has an
        Ionic portico of four columns, but\r\n  having no pediment does not make so
        agreeable a figure as could be\r\n  wished.\r\n\r\n  This is one of the finest
        seats in England belonging to a private\r\n  gentleman; it is adorned with
        many capital pictures, a list whereof is\r\n  here given; and the gardens,
        park, and country around, render it a\r\n  most delightful seat: yet this
        fine edifice was begun, raised, and\r\n  covered, in the space of eleven months.
        At a small distance is the\r\n  College erected by Sir John Morden, Bart.

        _hall_, Basinghall street, a very ancient edifice, employed\r\n  for several
        ages as a market for all kinds of woollen cloth brought to\r\n  London. This
        edifice was originally called Basing\u2019s Haugh or Hall;\r\n  probably from
        the family of the Basings, who first built the house,\r\n  and whose arms
        were placed in many parts of it, painted on the walls,\r\n  and cut in the
        stone-work. From this family, who were owners also of\r\n  the adjoining ground.
        Stow supposes, that \u201Cthe ward itself took its\r\n  name, as Coleman street
        ward of Coleman, and Faringdon ward, of\r\n  William and Nicholas Faringdon.\u201D
        Of this family the same author\r\n  observes, that Solomon Basing was Mayor
        in the year 1216; and that to\r\n  Adam Basing his son, who was also afterwards
        Mayor, King Henry III.\r\n  gave the advowson of the church at Basing Hall,
        and several liberties\r\n  and privileges.\r\n\r\n  In the 36th year of Edward
        III. this house was inhabited by Mr. Thomas\r\n  Bakewell, whence it obtained
        the name of Bakewell Hall; a name that\r\n  was afterwards corrupted to that
        of Blackwell Hall. At length it was\r\n  purchased, with the garden and appurtenances,
        of King Richard II. by\r\n  the city, for the sum of 50_l._ and from that
        time has been chiefly\r\n  employed as a weekly market for all the broad and
        narrow woollen\r\n  cloths brought out of the country.\r\n\r\n  This house
        at length growing ruinous, was rebuilt in the form of a\r\n  handsome store
        house in the year 1558, at the charge of 2500_l._ but\r\n  an hundred and
        eight years after was destroyed by the fire of London,\r\n  and again rebuilt
        in 1672; this last is the present edifice.\r\n\r\n  It is a square building
        with a court in the middle surrounded with\r\n  warehouses, and has two spacious
        entrances for carriages, one from\r\n  Basinghall street, and the other opposite
        to it by Guildhall. This\r\n  last is the principal front, and has the door-case
        adorned with two\r\n  columns of the Doric order, with their entablature,
        and a pediment, in\r\n  which are the King\u2019s arms, and a little lower
        the city arms enriched\r\n  with Cupids, _&c._\r\n\r\n  In this edifice are
        the Devonshire, Gloucester, Worcester, Kentish,\r\n  Medley, Spanish, and
        Blanket Halls, in which each piece of cloth pays\r\n  one penny for pitching,
        and a half-penny per week resting; and the\r\n  profits, which are said to
        amount to about 1100_l._ _per annum_, are\r\n  applied towards the support
        of Christ\u2019s Hospital, the Governors\r\n  whereof have the whole management
        of these warehouses. There are\r\n  several statutes relating to the regulation
        of this market, with\r\n  respect to the factors, and others concerned.\r\n\r\nBLACKWELL

        is annually\r\n  chosen at the Lord of the Mannor\u2019s court. The town,
        which is five\r\n  miles from Ryegate, and twenty from London, being situated
        on a hill,\r\n  on the side of Holmsdale, affords a fine prospect, as far
        as Sussex\r\n  and the South Downs, and from some of the ruins of the castle,
        which\r\n  are still visible, tho\u2019 in the midst of a coppice, one may
        take a view\r\n  to the west into Hampshire, and to the east into Kent. Here
        is a free\r\n  school and an almshouse; but the spire of the church was consumed
        by\r\n  lightning and all the bells melted in the year 1606.\r\n\r\nBLEEDING

        so denominated from St. Botolph, a monk\r\n  born in Cornwall, is situated
        at the south east corner of Little\r\n  Britain, and tho\u2019 the fire in
        1666 did not reach this edifice, it from\r\n  that time fell into decay, and
        was great part of it rebuilt in 1757.\r\n  It is a plain brick edifice with
        a tower supported on a kind of arch\r\n  work, and crowned with an open turret,
        and its fane. It is a curacy in\r\n  the patronage of the Dean and Chapter
        of Westminster Abbey; but is\r\n  subject to the Bishop and Archdeacon of
        London, to whom it pays\r\n  procuration.\r\n\r\n_St._ BOTOLPH\u2019S _Aldgate_,
        situated on the east side of Houndsditch,\r\n  fronting the Minories. The
        old church escaped the fire in 1666, and\r\n  stood till the year 1741, when
        it was taken down, and the present\r\n  edifice finished in 1744. It is built
        with brick, and is a plain,\r\n  massy, and yet elegant structure. It consists
        of a body of a regular\r\n  shape, and a lofty and well-proportioned steeple,
        formed of a tower\r\n  and spire. Its greatest ornament is a bold rustic with
        which it is\r\n  strengthened at the corners. This church is a curacy, and
        the\r\n  impropriation is held in fee of the Crown. The Curate, besides other\r\n
        \ considerable advantages, receives 400_l._ a year by tithes. _Newc.\r\n  Rep.
        Eccles._\r\n\r\n_St._ BOTOLPH\u2019S _Billingsgate_, a rectory, the church
        whereof formerly\r\n  stood opposite to Botolph lane, in Thames street, in
        Billingsgate\r\n  ward; but being destroyed by the fire of London, and not
        rebuilt, the\r\n  parish was by act of parliament annexed to St. George\u2019s
        Botolph lane.\r\n\r\n_St._ BOTOLPH\u2019S _Bishopsgate_, opposite the north
        end of Houndsditch.\r\n  The old church escaping the general conflagration
        in 1666, at length\r\n  fell into decay, and the present structure was raised
        by act of\r\n  parliament, at the expence of the parish. It is a massy and
        spacious\r\n  edifice. The body is well built with brick, and well enlightened,
        and\r\n  the roof hid by a handsome balustrade. On the inside the roof is\r\n
        \ arched, except over the galleries, and two rows of Corinthian columns\r\n
        \ support both the galleries and arch which extends over the body of the\r\n
        \ church, and is neatly adorned with fret work, from which hang several\r\n
        \ handsome gilt branches. The steeple, tho\u2019 heavy, has an air of\r\n
        \ magnificence. In the center of the front is a large plain arched\r\n  window,
        decorated at a distance with pilasters of the Doric order.\r\n  Over this
        window is a festoon, and above that an angular pediment; on\r\n  each side
        is a door crowned with windows, and over these others of the\r\n  porthole
        kind; above these last rises a square tower crowned with a\r\n  dome, whose
        base is circular, and surrounded by a balustrade in the\r\n  same form; by
        the side of which, on the corners of the tower, are\r\n  placed urns with
        flames. From this part rises a series of coupled\r\n  Corinthian columns,
        supporting other urns like the former, and over\r\n  them rises the orgive
        dome, crowned with a very large vase with\r\n  flames. The Author of _The
        Critical Review_ says, that he thinks this\r\n  steeple more in taste than
        most about town; and that the parts of\r\n  which it is composed are simple,
        beautiful and harmonious. The author\r\n  of _The English Architecture_, however,
        observes, \u201CThat the placing of\r\n  a window in the middle of the street,
        where the principal door should\r\n  have been, is an error of the first magnitude.
        The most unlearned eye\r\n  must perceive a strange imperfection in this,
        though without knowing\r\n  what it is; and there is something in the highest
        degree disgustful,\r\n  at being shut out by a dead wall at the proper and
        natural entrance.\u201D\r\n  But in justification of the architect, it may
        be alledged, that this\r\n  being the east end, he might not be allowed to
        form a door in the\r\n  center, where the altar is placed under a noble arch
        beneath the\r\n  steeple; and that much greater improprieties than this are
        daily seen,\r\n  from the idle custom which has generally prevailed of placing
        the\r\n  altar to the east in spight of any inconveniences it may occasion,
        as\r\n  in St. Clement\u2019s in the Strand, St. Dunstan\u2019s in Fleet street,
        and\r\n  many others. This church is a rectory, the patronage of which is
        in\r\n  the Bishop of London. The Rector, besides other considerable\r\n  advantages,
        receives about 200_l._ a year by tithes,\r\n\r\nBOTOLPH _lane_, Little Eastcheap.\u2020\r\n\r\nBOTOLPH\u2019S

        for that number\r\n  of poor freemen or their widows, and endowed this almshouse

        Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject
        Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public
        support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number
        of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine
        readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated
        equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
        to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is
        committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable
        donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements
        are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and
        many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit
        donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation
        of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance
        for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we

        to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we
        cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received
        from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease

        5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor
        Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept
        of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone.
        For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks
        with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm
        eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are
        confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright
        notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance
        with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web
        site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis
        Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how
        to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation,
        how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter
        to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n"

      \                               PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is hoped that the great
      variety of new, useful, curious and\r\nentertaining articles which will be found
      in the following work, will\r\nentitle it to a favourable reception from the
      public. No pains nor\r\nexpence have been spared to give it as much accuracy
      and perfection as\r\nthe nature of such a work will admit of. And though we
      do not flatter\r\nourselves that it will be absolutely free from errors or imperfections,\r\nyet
      we doubt not but the candid reader will find so much to commend,\r\nthat he
      will easily be inclined to excuse some unavoidable deficiencies.\r\n\r\nThe
      Environs of London, though they contain many of the most remarkable\r\nseats
      and places in the kingdom, have never before been included in any\r\naccount
      of that metropolis; and we are persuaded, that the most\r\nintelligent enquirer
      will here find numberless curiosities, not hitherto\r\ntaken notice of by any
      other writers: besides, we have not only been\r\nparticular in our descriptions
      of whatever is remarkable twenty miles\r\nround; but to assist his observation,
      we have added a map, which we\r\nflatter ourselves will be found to have some
      advantages over any other\r\nthat has yet appeared. This map, and these descriptions,
      will serve both\r\nas a guide and an instructor to the travelling Virtuosi,
      whether natives\r\nor foreigners, in their little excursions to any part of
      these\r\ndelightfully adorned and richly cultivated environs.\r\n\r\nIn order
      to render the knowledge of this metropolis as complete as\r\npossible, we have
      necessarily been obliged, in conformity with our plan,\r\nto treat of what may
      to some appear little and uninteresting, as well as\r\nof what is great and
      important. Among these the citizens are\r\nparticularly interested in knowing
      the extent and limits of the wards in\r\nwhich they reside: and it was absolutely
      necessary to mention in their\r\nproper places all the several companies that
      compose their whole body:\r\nand as every inhabitant of the kingdom may, at
      one time or another, have\r\noccasion to visit or write to their friends or
      relations residing in\r\nthis great city, the names and situation of all the
      several streets,\r\nlanes, rows, courts, yards and allies could not be omitted.
      With regard\r\nto these an ingenious gentleman has furnished us with a key,
      which has\r\nlet us into the origin of many of their names; and this part of
      our work\r\nis farther illustrated by a new and correct plan.\r\n\r\nThe prints
      with which the whole is decorated, are all engraved by the\r\nbest hands, after
      original drawings, which were taken on purpose for\r\nthis work, from the several
      objects themselves, at a very great expence;\r\nand we imagine they will not
      only be considered as an ornament, but that\r\nthey will be found of use in
      illustrating the verbal descriptions.\r\n\r\nWe beg leave in this place to make
      our grateful acknowledgments to\r\nseveral of the nobility and gentry, who have
      been pleased to favour us\r\non this occasion with lists and accounts of their
      pictures, curiosities,\r\n&c. which have greatly enriched and added a value
      to our work; and being\r\nentirely new, cannot but be acceptable to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:

      &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2020 _Those with this mark generally derived their name from
      the ground\r\n    landlord, who built the street, lane, or alley, &c._\r\n\r\n*

      \                                  A\r\n\r\n\r\nABBEY _Church of St. Peter\u2019s,
      Westminster_. Many have been the fables\r\ninvented and propagated by the monks,
      relating to the original\r\nfoundation of this ancient edifice; but the most
      probable account is\r\ngiven by those who place it under Sebert, King of the
      East Saxons, who\r\ndied in 616. These say, that this Prince being converted
      to christianity\r\nby Austin\u2019s discourses, and his uncle Ethelbert\u2019s
      example, erected this\r\nchurch on the ruins of a temple dedicated to Apollo,
      in the island of\r\nThorney, and caused Mellitus, Bishop of London, to consecrate
      it to St.\r\nPeter.\r\n\r\nAs many ridiculous miracles have been related of
      its foundation, it is\r\nthe less surprizing that its dedication should also
      be represented as\r\nmiraculous, and that St. Peter himself, five hundred years
      after his\r\ndecease, should be represented by the monks, as doing honour to
      the new\r\nfabric, by performing the ceremony himself. For according to the
      legend,\r\nthe King having ordered Mellitus to perform the ceremony, St. Peter\r\nover-night
      called upon Edricus, a fisherman, and desired to be ferried\r\nover to Thorney,
      which happened to be then overflowed by the heavy rains\r\nthat had lately fallen;
      the fisherman consented, and having carried over\r\nthe Apostle, he saw him
      consecrate the church amidst a grand chorus of\r\ncelestial music, and a glorious
      appearance of heavenly lights. After\r\nwhich the Apostle returning, discovered
      himself to the fisherman, and\r\nbid him tell Mellitus what he had heard and
      seen, and as a proof of his\r\ndivine mission, gave him a miraculous draught
      of salmon, and then\r\nassured him, that none of his profession should ever
      want that kind of\r\nfish in the proper season, provided they made an offering
      of the tenth\r\nfish for the use of the new church; which custom, it seems,
      was\r\ncontinued by the fishermen four hundred years after.\r\n\r\nThis church
      and its monastery were afterwards repaired and enlarged by\r\nOffa, King of
      Mercia, but being destroyed by the Pagan Danes, they were\r\nrebuilt by King
      Edgar, who endowed them with lands and manors, and in\r\nthe year 969 granted
      them many ample privileges.\r\n\r\nThe church and monastery having again suffered
      by the ravages of the\r\nDanes, were again rebuilt by Edward the Confessor,
      who pulled down the\r\nold church, and erected a most magnificent one, for that
      age, in its\r\nroom, in the form of a cross, which afterwards became a pattern
      for that\r\nkind of building. The work being finished in the year 1065, he caused
      it\r\nto be consecrated with the greatest pomp and solemnity, and by several\r\ncharters
      not only confirmed all its ancient rights and privileges, but\r\nendowed it
      with many rich manors, and additional immunities: ordained\r\nthat all its lands
      and possessions, should be subject to none but its\r\nown jurisdiction, and
      the convent be free from the authority of the\r\nBishop of London; and the church,
      by a bull of Pope Nicholas I. was\r\nconstituted the place for the inauguration
      of the Kings of England. In\r\nshort, he gave it a charter of sanctuary, in
      which he declares, that any\r\nperson whatsoever, let his crimes be ever so
      great, who takes sanctuary\r\nin that holy place, shall be assured of life,
      liberty, and limbs, and\r\nthat none of his ministers, nor those of his successors,
      should seize\r\nany of his goods, lands or possessions, under pain of everlasting\r\ndamnation,
      and that whoever presumed to act contrary to this grant,\r\nshould lose his
      name, worship, dignity, and power, and with the traitor\r\nJudas, be in the
      everlasting fire of hell. This was the pious language\r\nof St. Edward the Confessor,
      and from this charter, Westminster Abbey\r\nbecame an asylum for traitors, murderers,
      robbers, and the most\r\nabandoned miscreants, who lived there in open defiance
      of the laws.\r\n\r\nThis, and King Edward\u2019s other charters, in which he
      recites the\r\nridiculous story of its consecration by St. Peter, as above related,
      its\r\ndestruction by the Danes, the grants and privileges of his predecessors,\r\nand
      those bestowed by himself, drew people thither from all parts, so\r\nthat in
      a short time there was not sufficient room in the Abbey church\r\nfor the accommodation
      of the numerous inhabitants, without incommoding\r\nthe monks; he therefore
      caused a church to be erected on the north side\r\nof the monastery, for the
      use of the inhabitants, and dedicated it to\r\nSt. Margaret.\r\n\r\nWilliam
      the Conqueror, to shew his regard to the memory of his late\r\nfriend King Edward,
      no sooner arrived in London, than he repaired to\r\nthis church, and offered
      a sumptuous pall, as a covering for his tomb;\r\nhe also gave fifty marks of
      silver, together with a very rich altar\r\ncloth, and two caskets of gold; and
      the Christmas following was solemnly\r\ncrowned there, his being the first coronation
      performed in that place.\r\n\r\nThe next Prince who improved this great work,
      was Henry III. who in the\r\nyear 1200 began to erect a new chapel to the blessed
      Virgin; but about\r\ntwenty years after, finding the walls and steeple of the
      old structure\r\nmuch decayed, he pulled them all down, with a design to enlarge,
      and\r\nrebuild them in a more regular manner; but he did not live to accomplish\r\nthis
      great work, which was not compleated till 1285, about fourteen\r\nyears after
      his decease. And this is the date of the building as it now\r\nstands.\r\n\r\nAbout
      the year 1502, King Henry began that magnificent structure which\r\nis now generally
      called by his name; for this purpose, he pulled down\r\nthe chapel of Henry
      III. already mentioned, and an adjoining house\r\ncalled the White Rose Tavern;
      this chapel, like the former, he dedicated\r\nto the blessed Virgin, and designing
      it for a burial place for himself\r\nand his posterity, he carefully ordered
      in his will, that none but those\r\nof royal blood should be permitted to lie
      there.\r\n\r\nAt length on the general suppression of religious houses, the
      Abbey was\r\nsurrendered to Henry VIII. by William Benson, the Abbot, and seventeen\r\nof
      the monks, in the year 1539, when its revenues amounted to 3977_l._\r\n6_s._
      4_d._ \xBE _per annum_, a sum at least equal to 20,000_l._ a year at\r\npresent.
      Besides its furniture, which was of inestimable value, it had\r\nin different
      parts of the kingdom, no less than two hundred, and sixteen\r\nmanors, seventeen
      hamlets, and ninety-seven towns and villages. And tho\u2019\r\nthe Abbey was
      only the second in rank, yet in all other respects it was\r\nthe chief in the
      kingdom; and its Abbots having episcopal jurisdiction,\r\nhad a seat in the
      house of Lords.\r\n\r\nThe Abbey thus dissolved, that Prince erected first into
      a college of\r\nsecular Canons, under the government of a Dean, an honour which
      he chose\r\nto confer on the last Abbot. This establishment, however, was of
      no long\r\nduration, for two years after he converted it into a bishopric, which\r\nwas
      dissolved nine years after by Edward VI. who restored the government\r\nby a
      Dean, which continued till Mary\u2019s accession to the crown; when she,\r\nin
      1557, restored it to its ancient conventual state; but Queen\r\nElizabeth again
      ejected the monks, and in 1560 erected Westminster Abbey\r\ninto a college,
      under the government of a Dean, and twelve secular\r\nCanons or Prebendaries,
      a Schoolmaster, Usher, and forty Scholars,\r\ndenominated the Queen\u2019s,
      to be educated in the liberal sciences\r\npreparatory to the university, and
      to have all the necessaries of life,\r\nexcept cloathing, of which they were
      to have only a gown every year. To\r\nthis foundation also belong choristers,
      singing-men, an organist, twelve\r\nalmsmen, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Abbey church, which
      was stripped of many of its decorations by Henry\r\nVIII. and was much damaged
      both within and without during the unhappy\r\ncivil commotions that defaced
      the ancient beauty of most of the\r\nreligious houses in this kingdom, has continued
      from the death of Henry\r\nVII. almost to the present time, without any other
      considerable repairs,\r\nand was gradually falling to ruin, when the Parliament
      interposed, and\r\nordered a thorough reparation at the national expence.\r\n\r\nThis
      venerable fabric has been accordingly new coated on the outside,\r\nexcept that
      part called Henry the Seventh\u2019s chapel, which is indeed a\r\nseparate building:
      and the west end has been adorned with two new\r\nstately towers that have been
      lately rebuilt, in such a manner as to be\r\nthought equal in point of workmanship
      to any part of the ancient\r\nbuilding; but though such pains have been taken
      in the coating, to\r\npreserve the ancient Gothic grandeur, that this church
      in its distant\r\nprospect has all the venerable majesty of its former state,
      yet the\r\nbeautiful carving with which it was once adorned, is irretrievably
      lost;\r\nthe buttresses, once capped with turrets, are now made in plain\r\npyramidical
      forms, and topped with freestone; and the statues of our\r\nancient Kings that
      formerly stood in niches, near the tops of those\r\nbuttresses, are for the
      most part removed, and their broken fragments\r\nlodged in the roof of Henry
      the Seventh\u2019s chapel. Three of these statues\r\nare still standing next
      the towers on the north side, and indeed that is\r\nthe only side where you
      can take a view of the Abbey, the other side\r\nbeing so incumbered with buildings,
      that even its situation cannot be\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nWhat next to the
      new towers principally engages the attention on the\r\noutside, is the Gothic
      portico which leads into the north cross, which\r\nby some has been stiled _the
      Beautiful_, or _Solomon\u2019s Gate_. This was\r\nprobably built by Richard
      II. as his arms carved in stone was formerly\r\nover the gate. It has been lately
      beautified, and over it is a new\r\nwindow admirably well executed. Besides
      these there is little in the\r\noutward appearance capable of engaging the attention,
      and its principal\r\nbeauties are to be found within.\r\n\r\nThe author of the
      work entitled _English Architecture_, seems to prefer\r\nthe Gothic to the Grecian
      architecture, as most suited to the purposes\r\nof devotion, and gives this
      edifice as an instance, \u201CThere is in it,\r\nsays he, a majesty and grandeur,
      a sedate, and if we may so speak,\r\nreligious dignity, which immediately strikes
      the imagination; and never\r\nfailed to impress on the most insensible observer,
      that holy awe which\r\nshould attend, and which always disposes the mind to
      devotion.\u201D But this\r\nholy awe, thus mechanically incited, would be as
      friendly to Paganism as\r\nto Christianity; and indeed, this awe is so far from
      being holy, that it\r\nis a thing entirely distinct from rational piety and
      devotion, and may\r\nbe felt without any inclination to enter the choir.\r\n\r\nIndeed
      the multiplicity of puerile ornaments profusely lavished, the\r\nstrong and
      beautiful perspective, and that romantic air of grandeur so\r\nvisible in this
      structure, and above all the height of the middle isle\r\nat our first entrance,
      fill the eye, strike us in a very forcible\r\nmanner, and at once raise our
      admiration and astonishment. To which let\r\nit be added, that the ranges of
      venerable monuments on each hand, some\r\nof them most magnificent, have a natural
      tendency to strike the mind\r\nwith an uncommon degree of solemnity, and to
      raise the most serious\r\nreflections.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the building is
      very considerable; for it is 360 feet\r\nwithin the walls, at the nave it is
      72 feet broad, and at the cross 195.\r\nThe Gothic arches and side isles are
      supported by 48 pillars of grey\r\nmarble, each composed of clusters of very
      slender ones, and covered with\r\nornaments. The moment you enter the west door
      the whole body of the\r\nchurch opens itself at once to your view, the pillars
      dividing the nave\r\nfrom the side isles being so formed as not to obstruct
      the side\r\nopenings, nor is your sight terminated to the east, but by the fine\r\npainted
      window over Edward the Confessor\u2019s chapel, which anciently, when\r\nthe
      altar was low, and adorned with the beautiful shrine of that\r\npretended saint,
      must have afforded one of the finest prospects that can\r\nbe imagined.\r\n\r\nThe
      pillars are terminated to the east by a sweep, enclosing the chapel\r\nof Edward
      the Confessor, in a kind of semicircle. And it is worthy of\r\nobservation,
      that as far as the gates of the choir, the pillars are\r\nfilletted with brass,
      but all beyond with stone. Answering to the middle\r\nrange of pillars, there
      are others in the wall, which as they rise,\r\nspring into semiarches, and are
      every where met in acute angles by their\r\nopposites, and meeting in the roof
      are adorned with a variety of\r\ncarvings. On the arches of the pillars are
      galleries of double columns\r\nfifteen feet wide, covering the side isles, and
      enlightened by a middle\r\nrange of windows, over which there is an upper range
      of larger windows,\r\nand by these, together with the four capital windows,
      facing the north,\r\neast, south and west, the whole fabric is so admirably
      enlightened, that\r\nin the day you are never dazzled with its brightness, nor
      incommoded by\r\nits being too dark. But before we leave these capital windows,
      which are\r\nall finely painted, it is necessary to observe, that in the great
      west\r\nwindow is a curious painting of Edward III. to the left of which in
      a\r\nsmaller window is a painting of one of our Kings, supposed to be Richard\r\nII.
      but the colours being of a water blue the features of the face\r\ncannot be
      distinguished. On the other side the great window is a lively\r\nrepresentation
      of Edward the Confessor in his robes, and under his feet\r\nare painted his
      arms. At the bottom of the walls between the pillars are\r\nshallow niches,
      arched about eight or ten feet high, on which the arms\r\nof the original benefactors
      are depicted, and over them are their\r\ntitles, &c. but these are almost all
      concealed by the monuments of the\r\ndead placed before them, many of which
      are extremely noble, and which we\r\nshall particularly examine after having
      gone through the several parts\r\nof the edifice.\r\n\r\nAfter viewing the open
      part of the church, the next thing to be seen is\r\nthe choir, which can only
      be done during the times of divine service.\r\nThe grand entrance into it is
      by a pair of fine iron gates, on each side\r\nof which is a very magnificent
      tomb. The floor is paved with the finest\r\nblack and white marble. The ancient
      stalls are covered with Gothic acute\r\narches, supported by small iron pillars,
      and are painted purple; but\r\nwhat is most worthy of observation, is an ancient
      portrait near the\r\npulpit, of Richard II. sitting in a gilt chair, dressed
      in a green vest\r\nflowered with gold, with gold shoes powdered with pearls.
      This piece is\r\nsix feet eleven inches in length, and three feet seven inches
      in\r\nbreadth; but the lower part is much defaced.\r\n\r\nThe next thing worthy
      of observation is the fine altar enclos\u2019d with a\r\ncurious balustrade,
      within which is a pavement of mosaic work, laid at\r\nthe expence of Abbot Ware,
      in the year 1272, and is said to be one of\r\nthe most beautiful of its kind
      in the world: the stones of which it is\r\ncomposed are porphyry, jasper, lydian
      and serpentine. The altar is a\r\nbeautiful piece of marble, removed from Whitehall,
      and presented to this\r\nchurch by order of her majesty Queen Anne. On each
      side of the altar are\r\ndoors, opening into St. Edward\u2019s chapel.\r\n\r\n_Of
      the several Chapels in Westminster Abbey._ Besides that of Henry\r\nVII. which,
      as we have already observed, is a separate building, and\r\nwill therefore be
      mentioned by itself when we have finished our survey\r\nof the Abbey, there
      are ten chapels, round that of St. Edward the\r\nConfessor, which stands as
      it were in the center, and, as has been said,\r\nis inclosed in the body of
      the church, at the east end of the choir,\r\nbehind the altar; these, beginning
      from the north cross, and passing\r\nround to the south cross, are in the following
      order: St. Andrew\u2019s, St.\r\nMichael\u2019s, St. John the Evangelist\u2019s,
      Islip\u2019s chapel, St. John the\r\nBaptist\u2019s, St. Paul\u2019s, Henry
      the Fifth\u2019s, St. Nicholas\u2019s, St. Edmund\u2019s,\r\nand St. Benedict\u2019s.\r\n\r\n_The
      Chapel of St. Edward._ The first curiosity that here fixes our\r\nattention,
      is the ancient shrine erected by Henry III. upon the\r\ncanonization of Edward
      King of England, the third of that name before\r\nthe conquest, and the last
      of the Saxon race; a Prince who owed the\r\ntitle of Confessor and Saint, to
      the vast sums he bestowed on the\r\nchurch, and the sollicitations of the monks,
      than to his own personal\r\nmerit: for he was a bad son, a bad husband, and
      so bad a king, that he\r\nshewed greater favour to the Normans than to his own
      people, and by his\r\nfolly prepared the way for the conquest. He died in the
      year 1066, and\r\nwas canonized by Pope Alexander III. in 1269. This shrine,
      which was\r\nonce esteemed the glory of England, is now much defaced and neglected.\r\nIt
      was composed of stones of various colours, beautifully enriched with\r\nall
      the cost that art could devise. No sooner was it erected, than the\r\nwealth
      of the kingdom flowed to it from all quarters. Henry III. set the\r\nfirst example,
      though he afterwards made use of the jewels and treasure\r\nhe offered there,
      to defray the charges of an expedition into France.\r\nBefore this shrine was
      a lamp kept continually burning, on one side\r\nstood a silver image of the
      blessed Virgin, which with two jewels of\r\nimmense value, were presented by
      Queen Eleanor, the wife of Henry III.\r\non the other side stood another image
      of the Virgin Mary, wrought in\r\nivory, presented by Thomas Becket, Archbishop
      of Canterbury. Here also\r\nEdward I. offered the Scots regalia and chair, in
      which the kings of\r\nScotland used to be crowned, which is still preserved
      and shewn to all\r\nstrangers. And about the year 1280, Alphonso, third son
      to the last\r\nmentioned king, offered here the golden coronet of Llewellyn,
      Prince of\r\nWales, and other jewels; but it would almost fill a volume to enumerate\r\nthe
      offerings made at this shrine. Yet it is now so stripped as to\r\nafford no
      satisfaction, except to the curious; however some of the\r\nstone-work with
      which it is adorned, is still to be seen. This\r\nstone-work is hollow within,
      and now incloses a large chest, which Mr.\r\nKeep, soon after the coronation
      of James II. found to contain the\r\nremains of St. Edward; for it being broken
      by accident, he discovered a\r\nnumber of bones, and turning them up, found
      a crucifix, richly\r\nornamented and enamell\u2019d with a gold chain of twenty
      inches long, both\r\nwhich he presented to his Majesty, who ordered the bones
      to be replaced\r\nin the old coffin, and enclosed in a new one made very strong,
      and\r\nclamp\u2019d with iron.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of this shrine lies
      Editha, daughter to Goodwyn, Earl\r\nof Kent, and Queen to St. Edward, with
      whom she lived eighteen years,\r\nand tho\u2019 she was the most accomplished
      woman of that age, confessed on\r\nher death-bed, that he suffered her to live
      and die a virgin; and, as an\r\nancient manuscript in the Cotton library has
      it, \u201Cnathelees, tho\u2019 the\r\nKinge had a wyfe, he lived ev\u2019moe
      in chastete, and clennes, wythowten\r\nany fleshley dedes doynge wyth his wyfe
      the Queen, and so dyd the Queen\r\non her syde.\u201D She survived her husband
      eight years, and beheld all the\r\nmiseries consequent upon his dying without
      issue. She was however\r\ntreated with great respect by William the Conqueror,
      who allowed her an\r\napartment in the King\u2019s palace at Winchester, where
      she died, and was\r\ninterred here, by his express orders.\r\n\r\nNear the remains
      of this Princess lie those of Queen Maud, surnam\u2019d the\r\nGood, the daughter
      of Malcolm Conmair, King of Scotland, to whom she was\r\nespoused, in order
      to unite the Saxon and Norman lines, and thereby to\r\nreconcile the affections
      of the English to the future Kings that should\r\nspring from them. She died
      on the 11th of May 1118. This excellent\r\nPrincess was distinguished by her
      many virtues, particularly her\r\nhumility, and her placing her chief delight
      in relieving the poor.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of this chapel is the tomb of
      Henry III. the pannels\r\nare of polish\u2019d porphyry, and around them is
      mosaic work of gold and\r\nscarlet. At the corners of the table are twisted
      pillars, gilt, and\r\nenamell\u2019d, and upon it is placed the effigy of that
      King in brass gilt,\r\nfinely executed. He died in 1272, aged 65, after a troublesome
      reign of\r\n56 years.\r\n\r\nAt the feet of the last mentioned Prince lies the
      effigy of Eleanor,\r\nQueen to Edward I. On the sides of this monument are engraven
      the arms\r\nof Castile and Leon, quarterly, and those of Ponthieu, hanging on
      vines\r\nand oak-trees, and round the copper verge is embossed this inscription\r\nin
      Saxon characters;\r\n\r\n              _Icy gist Alianor Jadis Reyne de Angleterre,\r\n
      \                      Femme al. Re. Edward Fiz._\r\n\r\n                                That
      is,\r\n\r\n               _Here lies Eleanor, once Queen of England,\r\n                         Wife
      to King Edward._\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, that the body of this Queen was only
      interred here,\r\nand that her heart was placed in the choir of the friars predicants
      in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nThere is also here a large plain coffin of grey marble,
      composed of\r\nseven stones, four of which form the sides, two the ends, and
      one the\r\ncover. This rough unpolished tomb incloses the body of the glorious
      King\r\nEdward I. just mentioned, who was born on the 17th of June 1239. He
      was\r\nnamed Edward, in honour of Edward the Confessor, and afterwards surnamed\r\nLong
      Shanks, from his tall and slender habit of body. This brave Prince\r\ndied on
      the 7th of July 1307, aged 68.\r\n\r\nIn this chapel is a tomb of black marble,
      to the memory of Philippa, the\r\nthird daughter to William Earl of Hainault,
      and Queen to King Edward\r\nIII. who bestowed a profusion of expence on her
      tomb, round which were\r\nplaced as ornaments, the brazen statues of no less
      than thirty Kings,\r\nPrinces, and noble personages her relations.\r\n\r\nTho\u2019
      Edward III. was interred in the same grave as the Queen, he has a\r\nmonument
      erected for him adjoining to hers, covered with a Gothic\r\ncanopy. The effigy
      of this Prince, who died June 21, 1377, lies on a\r\ntomb of grey marble, and
      at his head are placed the shield and sword\r\ncarried before him in France:
      the latter is seven feet long, and weighs\r\neighteen pounds. This tomb was,
      like the former, surrounded with\r\nstatues, particularly with those of his
      children.\r\n\r\nNext to this is the tomb of Richard II. and his Queen, over
      which is a\r\ncanopy of wood, remarkable for a painting of the Virgin Mary and
      our\r\nSaviour still visible. This Prince was murdered on Valentine\u2019s day
      1399,\r\nand on the robing of his effigy are curiously wrought, peascod shells\r\nopen,
      and the peas out, perhaps in allusion to his being once in full\r\npossession
      of sovereignty, which before his murder, was reduced to an\r\nempty title.\r\n\r\nBetween
      St. Edward\u2019s shrine, and the tomb of Queen Philippa, under a\r\nlarge stone,
      once plated with brass, lies the great Thomas of Woodstock,\r\nDuke of Gloucester,
      and uncle to the above Richard II. who murdered him\r\non the 8th of September,
      1397, for being too free and too faithful a\r\nmonitor.\r\n\r\nHere is also
      a table monument in memory of Margaret, daughter to Edward\r\nIV. by his Queen
      Elizabeth Woodville; and a small monument of black\r\nLydian marble finely polished,
      in memory of Elizabeth Tudor, the second\r\ndaughter of Henry VIII who died
      at three years of age.\r\n\r\n_Henry the Fifth\u2019s Chapel_, is only parted
      from St. Edward\u2019s by an iron\r\nscreen, on each side of which are statues
      as big as the life. His\r\nmonument, which is surrounded with iron rails and
      gates, is of black\r\nmarble, and upon it is placed his statue; but what is
      very remarkable,\r\nit lies without the head. Your guides say, that the body
      is heart of\r\noak, and the head of beaten silver; as were also the scepter
      and other\r\nensigns of royalty with which this statue was adorned; but that
      the\r\nvalue of these occasioned their being sacrilegiously taken away. This
      is\r\nby some writers represented at a ridiculous tale. Over this tomb is a\r\nchauntry
      chapel, in which the weapons, armour, and caparisons of Henry\r\nV. were carefully
      laid up, and remain to this day.\r\n\r\nNear this tomb lies enclosed in an old
      wooden chest, the remains of\r\nCatharine, daughter of Charles VI. King of France,
      and the consort of\r\nHenry V. She died on the 2d of January 1437, and was honourably
      interred\r\nin the chapel erected by Henry III. but when her grandson Henry
      VII.\r\npulled down that to build his own chapel, her body was taken up, when\r\nthe
      bones appeared firmly united, and thinly covered with flesh; but the\r\ncoffin
      being decayed, was put into a wooden chest, and removed to the\r\nplace where
      it is now seen. This is the account given by those who shew\r\nthis venerable
      dust, the miserable remains of a lady of royal blood, and\r\nof distinguished
      beauty.\r\n\r\n_The Chapel of St. Andrew_, which is next the northern cross,
      has in the\r\ncenter a magnificent monument erected to the memory of Sir Francis\r\nNorris,
      ancestor to the late Sir John Norris. In the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth he
      distinguished himself by his bravery in the Low Countries,\r\nand was created
      Lord Norris of Rycot. This monument has a fine\r\nrepresentation of an encampment
      in relief, and is otherwise beautifully\r\nornamented; but has no inscription.\r\n\r\nAgainst
      the east wall is a table monument to the memory of Sir John\r\nBurgh, who was
      killed in 1594, in taking a large Spanish ship, laden\r\nwith gold, silver and
      jewels of inestimable value.\r\n\r\nIn one corner is an ancient monument of
      Robert Kirton, that has several\r\nlabels in black letters round his portrait,
      which rests upon eagles\r\ncrowned. He died Oct. 3, 1466.\r\n\r\n_St. Michael\u2019s
      Chapel_ has only one monument worthy of notice, which is\r\n  that of Sarah,
      Duchess of Somerset; and mother to the last Duke of\r\n  that branch of the
      family. On the base sit two charity boys, one on\r\n  each side, lamenting the
      loss of their great benefactress, who is\r\n  represented resting upon her arm,
      under a canopy of state, and looking\r\n  earnestly upon a group of cherubims,
      issuing from the clouds above\r\n  her. Underneath is a Latin inscription, enumerating
      her many\r\n  charitable foundations, and informing us that this excellent Lady
      died\r\n  on the 5th of September 1692.\r\n\r\n_St. John the Evangelist\u2019s
      Chapel_, has in the center a curious monument\r\n  to Sir Francis Vere, a gentleman
      of the first reputation for learning\r\n  and bravery, who particularly distinguished
      himself at the battle of\r\n  Newport, in which he commanded in front under
      Prince Maurice, in the\r\n  service of the States, against the Spaniards. This
      great warrior was\r\n  30 years in the Dutch service, and in 20 of them commanded
      the\r\n  auxiliary troops of England. He died on the 28th of August 1608, in\r\n
      \ the 54th year of his age. His monument is a table supported by four\r\n  knights
      kneeling, on which lie the several parts of a complete suit of\r\n  armour,
      and underneath the effigies of Sir Francis, lying, as if\r\n  undressed, in
      a loose gown, on a quilt of alabaster. On the base is a\r\n  short Latin inscription
      in gold letters, shewing to whom it belongs;\r\n  that he was nephew to the
      Earl of Oxford, and Governor of Portsmouth\r\n  and the Brille, and that his
      disconsolate widow consecrated this\r\n  monument to his memory.\r\n\r\n  Close
      to the wall is a monument of Sir George Hollis, nephew to Sir\r\n  Francis Vere,
      and a Major General under him. On the pedestal is\r\n  represented the siege
      of a town in relief, where the principal figure\r\n  is a General on horseback
      holding a battoon, and having one eye\r\n  blemished, perhaps alluding to the
      siege of Newport, in which Sir\r\n  George also gained great honour, and had
      a horse killed under him. On\r\n  each side of this pedestal sits a Pallas,
      lamenting the death of the\r\n  great warrior, who is represented above in the
      Roman habit, standing\r\n  erect upon a lofty altar, with a cherub supporting
      the plinth on which\r\n  he stands. Sir George died in January 1626. An ingenious
      author\r\n  speaking of this monument, says, that Sir George was the first erect\r\n
      \ figure set up in the Abbey; \u201Can attitude, says he, which I am far from\r\n
      \ discommending, for \u2019tis my opinion, statues should always represent\r\n
      \ life and action: \u2019tis peculiarly adapted to heroes, who ought never to\r\n
      \ be supposed at rest, and should have their characters represented as\r\n  strong
      as possible: this before us is bold and manly, though not\r\n  chaste and elegant:
      \u2019tis finely elevated too, and the mourning\r\n  Pallases, at the base of
      it, are both well fancied and well applied.\u201D\r\n\r\n  Near Sir Francis\u2019s
      tomb is that of Aubery de Vere, the last Earl of\r\n  Oxford of that name, and
      Lieutenant-General of Queen Anne\u2019s forces,\r\n  who died March 12, 1702.\r\n\r\n
      \ In this chapel there are also some antique monuments; particularly on\r\n
      \ the right hand, is that of John de Eastney, one of the Abbots, who was\r\n
      \ a great benefactor to this church, and died on the 4th of May 1438. A\r\n
      \ brazen statue of this Abbot in his mass habit, lies upon his tomb. It\r\n
      \ is remarkable, that in breaking up a grave about thirty years ago, his\r\n
      \ body was discovered in a coffin quilted with yellow sattin, having on\r\n
      \ a gown of crimson silk, girded round him with a black girdle; on his\r\n  legs
      were white silk stockings, and over his face a clean napkin\r\n  doubled up,
      and laid corner wise. His body and legs are said to have\r\n  been plump and
      firm, but his face somewhat discoloured.\r\n\r\n  There is likewise here the
      monument of Sir John Harpedon, Knt. who\r\n  died in 1457. He lies in armour,
      resting his feet on a lion, and his\r\n  head on a greyhound.\r\n\r\n_St. Erasmus\u2019s,
      or Islip\u2019s Chapel_, has but two monuments worthy of\r\n  notice; the first
      that of John Islip, Abbot of Westminster, the\r\n  founder of this chapel, which
      he dedicated to St. Erasmus. It is\r\n  adorned with much carving in devices,
      intaglios, and febuses, alluding\r\n  to the name of the founder, as a person
      slipping boughs off a tree; an\r\n  eye with the slip of the tree; and a youth
      sliding from a bough, with\r\n  _I slip_, in a label proceeding out of his mouth.
      In the middle is\r\n  Islip\u2019s tomb which is a plain marble table, supported
      by four small\r\n  brass pillars; over it was anciently painted on the roof,
      a picture of\r\n  our Saviour on the cross. He died in January 1510.\r\n\r\n
      \ The other is the tomb of Sir Christopher Hatton, son to Christopher\r\n  Hatton,
      Lord Chancellor of England. The principal figures are a knight\r\n  in armour,
      and a lady in deep mourning resting on the ascending sides\r\n  of a triangular
      pediment, parted in the middle by a trunkless helmet.\r\n  Over their heads
      is a neat piece of architecture, in the center of\r\n  which is a scroll with
      their arms, held up by naked boys, one of whom\r\n  holds an extinguished torch
      reversed over the Knight, to shew that Sir\r\n  Christopher died first; the
      other over the Lady holds his torch\r\n  upright and burning, to signify that
      she survived him. The inscription\r\n  informs us, that Sir Christopher died
      on the 10th of September 1619.\r\n\r\n  Over this chapel is a chauntry, in which
      are two large wainscot\r\n  presses, filled with the effigies of Princes, and
      others of high\r\n  quality, interred in the Abbey. These effigies, \u2019tis
      said, resembled\r\n  the deceased as near as possible, and were formerly exposed
      at the\r\n  funerals of our Princes and other great personages, in open chariots,\r\n
      \ with their proper ensigns of royalty or honour. Those here deposited\r\n  are
      all maimed, some stripped, and others in tattered robes; but the\r\n  most ancient
      are the least injured, which seems as if the value of\r\n  their cloaths had
      occasioned this ravage; for the robes of Edward VI.\r\n  that were once of crimson
      velvet, but now appear like leather, are\r\n  left entire; while those of Queen
      Elizabeth and King James I. are\r\n  taken away, as is every thing of value
      from all the rest.\r\n\r\n_St. John Baptist\u2019s Chapel_, contains several
      monuments: one at the\r\n  entrance is to the memory of Mrs. Mary Kendall, the
      daughter of Thomas\r\n  Kendall, Esq; she died in her thirty-third year, and
      her epitaph\r\n  informs us, that \u201Cher many virtues rendered her every
      way worthy of\r\n  that close union and friendship, in which she lived with
      Lady\r\n  Catharine Jones; and in testimony of which, she desired that even\r\n
      \ their ashes, after death, might not be divided; and therefore ordered\r\n
      \ herself here to be interred, where she knew that excellent Lady\r\n  designed
      one day to rest, near the grave of her beloved and religious\r\n  mother, Elizabeth
      Countess of Kendall.\u201D\r\n\r\n  Next to this is a monument erected to the
      memory of Col. Edward\r\n  Popham, and his Lady, whose statues in white marble
      stand under a\r\n  lofty canopy, resting their arms in a thoughtful posture
      upon a marble\r\n  altar, on which lie the gloves of an armed knight. This gentleman
      was\r\n  an active officer in Cromwell\u2019s army, and his atchievements were
      here\r\n  inscribed on his tomb. Upon the restoration, the monument was ordered\r\n
      \ to be demolished, and the inscription erased; but at the intercession\r\n
      \ of some of his Lady\u2019s relations, who had eminently served his Majesty,\r\n
      \ the stone whereon the inscription was cut was only turned inwards, and\r\n
      \ no other injury done to his monument.\r\n\r\n  In the midst of this chapel
      is a large table monument for Thomas\r\n  Cecil, Earl of Exeter, Baron Burleigh,
      Knight of the Garter, and Privy\r\n  Counsellor to King James I. whereon is
      placed his statue lying down,\r\n  with his Lady on his right side, and a vacant
      space on his left for\r\n  another. The Lady on his right side is his first
      wife the Lady Dorothy\r\n  Nevil, daughter to the Lord Latimer; and the vacant
      space was left for\r\n  his second wife, Frances Bridges, of the noble family
      of Chandois; but\r\n  as the right side was taken up, she gave express orders
      in her will,\r\n  not to place her effigy on his left, however, according to
      the\r\n  inscription, they are all buried together in one vault.\r\n\r\n  But
      the most magnificent monument in this chapel is against the east\r\n  wall,
      where stood the altar of St. John Baptist; this was erected to\r\n  the memory
      of Henry Carey, first cousin to Queen Elizabeth, who, on\r\n  being denied the
      honours of peerage, laid the disappointment so much\r\n  to heart, that he languished
      for a long time on a sick bed, at which\r\n  the Queen being moved, too late,
      created him a Baron, and ordered the\r\n  patent and robes to be laid before
      him, but without effect. He died on\r\n  the 23d of July 1596, aged seventy-two.\r\n\r\n
      \ Here also is a monument to Thomas Carey, second son to the Earl of\r\n  Monmouth,
      who is said to have died of grief in 1648, at the age of\r\n  thirty-three,
      on account of the untimely fate of his royal master King\r\n  Charles I.\r\n\r\n
      \ Here are likewise a few antique monuments, particularly one in which\r\n  the
      figure of a Bishop properly habited, lies under a Gothic canopy.\r\n  This is
      supposed to be erected for Thomas Rathal, Bishop of Durham,\r\n  who died in
      1524.\r\n\r\n  And an ancient stone monument for William of Colchester, whose\r\n
      \ effigies lie with the head supported by an angel, and the feet by a\r\n  lamb.\r\n\r\n_St.
      Paul\u2019s Chapel_, has on the left hand, a lofty monument erected to\r\n  the
      memory of Sir John Puckering, Knt. and Lord Chancellor in the\r\n  reign of
      Queen Elizabeth, in which office he died on the 20th of April\r\n  1596. His
      epitaph in Latin over his effigies, is thus translated:\r\n\r\n         The
      publick care and laws engag\u2019d my breast,\r\n           To live was toilsome,
      but to die is rest;\r\n         Wealth, maces, guards, crowns, titles, things
      that fade,\r\n           The prey of Time and sable Death are made.\r\n\r\n
      \                          VIRTUE INSPIRES MEN.\r\n\r\n             His Wife
      this statue rears to her lov\u2019d spouse,\r\n                 The test of
      constancy and marriage vows.\r\n        _I trust I shall see the Lord in the
      Land of the Living._\r\n\r\n  Adjoining to this monument, is one, much decay\u2019d,
      for Sir James\r\n  Fullerton and his Lady, whose effigies lie upon it, and on
      a table of\r\n  black marble is the following quaint inscription:\r\n\r\n               Here
      lie the Remains of Sir James Fullerton,\r\n                  Knt. first Gentleman
      of the Bedchamber\r\n                    to King Charles the First (Prince\r\n
      \                  and King) a generous Rewarder of all\r\n                 Virtue,
      a severe Reprover of all Vice, a\r\n                   profest Renouncer of
      all Vanity. He\r\n                  was a firm Pillar to the Commonwealth,\r\n
      \               a faithful Patron to the Catholic Church,\r\n                 a
      fair Pattern to the British Court. He\r\n                 lived to the Welfare
      of his Country, to\r\n                  the Honour of his Prince, to the Glory\r\n
      \                 of his God. He died _fuller_ of Faith\r\n                than
      of Fear, _fuller_ of Resolution than\r\n                of Pain, _fuller_ of
      Honour than of Days.\r\n\r\n  There is a monument erected to the memory of Sir
      James Bromley,\r\n  Chancellor to Queen Elizabeth, who died on the 12th of April
      1587.\r\n  This monument is of alabaster, with pillars of Lydian marble gilt,
      and\r\n  Sir James is represented lying in his Chancellor\u2019s habit, with
      his\r\n  four sons and four daughters kneeling on the base.\r\n\r\n  In the
      same chapel is a plain monument of Sir Dudley Carlton, who for\r\n  his services
      to King James I. and King Charles I. was made Viscount\r\n  Dorchester, and
      Secretary of State. He died on the 15th of February\r\n  1631, and is represented
      on his tomb sitting in a half rais\u2019d posture.\r\n\r\n  To the east of this
      monument is another of alabaster to the memory of\r\n  Frances the wife of Thomas
      Ratcliffe, Earl of Sussex, who\r\n  distinguished herself by her humanity and
      generosity, and died on the\r\n  15th of April 1589. She is represented in a
      recumbent posture, resting\r\n  on an embroidered cushion, dressed in robes,
      and with a coronet on her\r\n  head.\r\n\r\n  Next to this is the monument of
      Francis Lord Cottington of Hanworth,\r\n  who died on the 9th of June 1652,
      and of his Lady who died in 1633.\r\n  This monument is of black touchstone,
      and remarkably different from\r\n  every other in the Abbey, On the top is a
      circular frame of gilt\r\n  brass, enclosing the bust of the Lady, and beneath
      is his Lordship on\r\n  a table monument resting on his left arm, and over a
      satyr\u2019s head is\r\n  the inscription in English mentioning his Lordship\u2019s
      titles and\r\n  employments.\r\n\r\n_St. Nicholas\u2019s Chapel_ contains several
      remarkable monuments: near the\r\n  entrance is one of black marble, finely
      polished, to the memory of the\r\n  Lady Jane Clifford, youngest daughter to
      the Duke of Somerset, and\r\n  wife to Charles Lord Clifford and Dungarvan,
      who died Nov. 23, 1679.\r\n  This black monument is adorned with cherubims and
      a scroll of\r\n  alabaster, whereon is written a long inscription in English,\r\n
      \ containing an account of the Lady\u2019s descent and marriage.\r\n\r\n  By
      the door on the same side, is a monument of alabaster erected for\r\n  Lady
      Cecil, the daughter of Lord Cobham, who having married Sir Robert\r\n  Cecil,
      son to William Lord Burleigh, Treasurer of England, died in\r\n  child-bed in
      1591. The Latin inscription is a dialogue between herself\r\n  and husband,
      expressing their mutual affection.\r\n\r\n  At some distance is a magnificent
      temple of various coloured marble,\r\n  erected to the memory of Anne Duchess
      of Somerset, wife to Edward Duke\r\n  of Somerset. She died on the 16th of April
      1618, aged twenty-eight.\r\n  The inscription is in Latin and English, and contains
      a pompous detail\r\n  of the noble lineage of this great Lady, her alliances
      and issue.\r\n\r\n  In this chapel is likewise a very expensive monument, erected
      by the\r\n  great Lord Burleigh, to the memory of his wife Mildred, and their\r\n
      \ daughter the Lady Anne, Countess of Oxford, representing a stately\r\n  temple
      built with porphyry, and other kinds of marble gilt. It is\r\n  divided into
      two compartments, one elevated over the other. In the\r\n  lower lies Lady Burleigh,
      in a recumbent posture, with her daughter\r\n  Lady Jane in her arms; and at
      her head and feet are her children and\r\n  grand-children kneeling. In the
      upper compartment is the figure of a\r\n  venerable old man, supposed to be
      the Lord Burleigh, on his knees, as\r\n  if at fervent prayer. The Lady Burleigh
      died April 4, 1589, aged\r\n  sixty-three, after being forty years married,
      and her daughter, the\r\n  Lady Oxford, June 5, 1588. On the tomb is a long
      Latin inscription,\r\n  explaining the figures, and displaying their respective
      virtues and\r\n  accomplishments.\r\n\r\n  The next monument I shall mention
      in this chapel, is that of the Lady\r\n  Winifrid, married first to Sir Richard
      Sackville, Knt. and afterwards\r\n  to John Paulet, Marquis of Winchester. On
      the base are the figures of\r\n  a Knight armed and kneeling, and facing him
      a Lady in mourning also on\r\n  her knees; behind whose back lies an infant
      on a baptismal font with\r\n  its head supported by a pillow.\r\n\r\n  In the
      middle of the chapel is a fine raised monument of polished\r\n  marble, to the
      memory of Sir George Villars and his Lady, whose son\r\n  was raised by King
      James I. to the dignity of Duke of Buckingham.\r\n\r\n  In this chapel are two
      beautiful pyramids; the largest erected to the\r\n  memory of Nicholas Bagnal,
      a child of two months old, overlaid by his\r\n  nurse; the other to the memory
      of Anna Sophia Harley, a child of a\r\n  year old, daughter to the Hon. Christopher
      Harley Embassador to the\r\n  French King. She died in the year 1600, and her
      father, as appears by\r\n  the inscription, caused her heart to be inclosed
      in a cup, and placed\r\n  upon the top of the pyramid.\r\n\r\n  There are also
      in this chapel, a monument to the memory of the Lady\r\n  Elizabeth Fanes, and
      one or two others, scarcely worth notice.\r\n\r\n  _The Chapel of St. Edmund_,
      has at the entrance a lofty monument with\r\n  Gothic spires erected to the
      memory of John of Eltham, second son to\r\n  King Edward III. and so called
      from Eltham in Kent. His statue in\r\n  armour is of white alabaster, the head
      incircled by a coronet. He died\r\n  in Scotland at nineteen years of age, unmarried,
      tho\u2019 three different\r\n  matches had been proposed to him, the last of
      which, to Mary daughter\r\n  of Ferdinand King of Spain, he accepted, but lived
      not to consummate\r\n  it.\r\n\r\n  Next to this is a small table monument,
      on which lie the effigies of\r\n  William of Windsor, and Blanch of the Tower,
      the son and daughter of\r\n  Edward III. They took their surnames from the places
      of their birth,\r\n  and both died in their infancy. They are dressed in the
      habits of the\r\n  times, the young Prince in a short doublet, of the indecency
      of which\r\n  Chaucer\u2019s parson complains, and the Princess in a horned
      head-dress,\r\n  which Stow says, was frightful.\r\n\r\n  On another tomb lies
      the statue of the Lady Frances, Duchess of\r\n  Suffolk, represented dressed
      in her robes. She was the daughter of the\r\n  famous Charles Brandon by Mary
      the French Queen, daughter to Henry\r\n  VII. and became Duchess of Suffolk
      by marrying Henry Grey, Marquis of\r\n  Dorset, who, upon her father\u2019s
      decease, was created Duke of Suffolk.\r\n  On her tomb are two inscriptions,
      the first in Latin verse in praise\r\n  of her virtues, and the other in English,
      shewing her different\r\n  marriages.\r\n\r\n  The next is an elegant monument
      of white marble, erected by John Earl\r\n  of Clare, to the memory of his son
      Francis Hollis, a youth of great\r\n  bravery, who, after returning from making
      a campaign in Flanders, died\r\n  on the 12th of August 1622, aged eighteen.
      He is represented clad in\r\n  Grecian armour, sitting on a Greek altar. A good
      author mentioning\r\n  this statue, says, that it expresses more juvenile sweetness
      and\r\n  beauty, than any thing of the kind he ever saw, and that if this\r\n
      \ figure has any fault in character or design, it is being placed in a\r\n  languid
      sedentary posture, tho\u2019 cloathed in armour, and described as a\r\n  hero
      in his bloom; a more spirited attitude, he observes, would have\r\n  been more
      suitable to the person represented, would have given the\r\n  statuary greater
      latitude to exert his genius, and afforded more\r\n  satisfaction to the spectator.
      The epitaph on this is as follows:\r\n\r\n            What so thou hast of nature
      or of arts,\r\n            Youth, beauty, strength, or what excelling parts\r\n
      \           Of mind and body, letters, arms, and worth,\r\n            His eighteen
      years, beyond his years brought forth;\r\n            Then stand, and read thyself
      within this glass,\r\n            How soon these perish, and thy self may pass;\r\n
      \           Man\u2019s life is measur\u2019d by the work, not days,\r\n            No
      aged sloth, but active youth hath praise.\r\n\r\n  On an altar, in the same
      taste, but differently ornamented, sits the\r\n  statue of the Lady Elizabeth
      Russel, the daughter of Lord Russel. This\r\n  statue is of white alabaster,
      and the Lady is represented in a\r\n  sleeping posture. Your guides say, that
      she died with a prick of her\r\n  finger; but this story has no other foundation,
      than a misapprehension\r\n  of the statuary\u2019s design; for having represented
      her asleep, and\r\n  pointing with her finger to a death\u2019s head under her
      right foot, it\r\n  has been supposed, by the position of her finger pointing
      downwards,\r\n  that it was bleeding, and that this had closed her eyes in death;\r\n
      \ though the artist\u2019s design seems rather to allude to the composed\r\n
      \ situation of her mind at the approach of death, which she considered\r\n  only
      as a profound sleep, from which she was again to wake to a joyful\r\n  resurrection,
      of which the motto under her feet, is an evident\r\n  illustration; _Dormit,
      non mortua est_; \u201CShe is not dead, but\r\n  sleepeth.\u201D The Latin inscription
      on the scroll beneath, only tells\r\n  that this monument was erected to her
      memory by her afflicted sister\r\n  Anne. The device is an eagle, the emblem
      of eternity, resting on a\r\n  florilege of roses, &c.\r\n\r\n  Within the iron
      rails that inclose this last monument, is a\r\n  magnificent one to the memory
      of John Lord Russel, son and heir to\r\n  Francis Earl of Bedford, and of his
      young son Francis, by Elizabeth\r\n  the daughter of Sir Anthony Cook, Knt.
      This monument is of various\r\n  coloured marble and alabaster, and is adorned
      with gilding. Lord\r\n  Russel is represented lying in his robes, with his infant
      son at his\r\n  feet. His Lady, who erected this tomb, was esteemed the Sappho
      of the\r\n  age, and was not only an excellent poetess, but mistress of the\r\n
      \ learned languages; and five epitaphs on this tomb are of her\r\n  composition,
      three of which are in Latin, one in Greek, and the other\r\n  in English, which
      last is here transcribed as a specimen of the rest,\r\n  that are to the same
      purpose:\r\n\r\n             Right noble twice, by virtue, and by birth,\r\n
      \            Of Heaven lov\u2019d, and honour\u2019d on the earth:\r\n             His
      country\u2019s hope, his kindred\u2019s chief delight,\r\n             My husband
      dear, more the world\u2019s fair light,\r\n             Death hath me \u2019reft.
      But I from death will take\r\n             His memory, to whom this tomb I make.\r\n
      \            John was his name (ah, was!) wretch, must I say;\r\n             Lord
      Russel once, now my tear-thirsty clay.\r\n\r\n  In this chapel is a monument
      partly enclosed, to the memory of Talbot\r\n  Earl of Shrewsbury and his Lady,
      who are represented lying on a black\r\n  marble table supported by an alabaster
      pedestal. This monument is\r\n  adorned with variegated marble finely carved.
      The inscription contains\r\n  his titles and character, which is a very noble
      one, and informs us\r\n  that he died on the 8th of February 1617, in the fifty-seventh
      year of\r\n  his age.\r\n\r\n  In this chapel are several other monuments, adorned
      in their ancient\r\n  manner, with statues lying flat on the backs; and also
      some other\r\n  monuments affixed to the walls.\r\n\r\n  _The Chapel of St.
      Benedict_, which is that next to the south cross,\r\n  has a monument erected
      to the memory of Lionel Cranfield Earl of\r\n  Middlesex, Lord High Treasurer
      of England in the reign of King James\r\n  I. This monument was erected by his
      relict the Lady Anne, and is of\r\n  black marble, on which are two statues
      in a recumbent posture,\r\n  representing his Lordship lying in his robes, with
      his Lady. It has a\r\n  long Latin inscription, representing his various employments
      and\r\n  honours, and that he finished his life in a retired leisure, and died\r\n
      \ on the 6th of August 1645, aged seventy.\r\n\r\n  On the east side, where
      stood the altar of St. Benedict, is a monument\r\n  of various kinds of marble,
      in memory of Lady Frances Countess of\r\n  Hertford, who died on the 14th of
      May 1598, in the forty-fourth year\r\n  of her age. It is of various kinds of
      marble, and the Countess is in\r\n  the old taste represented in her robes,
      lying with her head resting on\r\n  an embroidered cushion, and her feet on
      the back of a lion.\r\n\r\n  On the south side of this chapel is a table monument
      of white marble\r\n  to the memory of George Sprat, the second son of Dr. Sprat,
      Bishop of\r\n  Rochester, an infant of a year old.\r\n\r\n  Near it is the monument
      of Dr. Gabriel Goodman, the first Dean of this\r\n  church, who founded an hospital,
      and instituted a school at Rathven in\r\n  Denbighshire, where he was born.
      He was a person of great piety, and\r\n  was the first who raised the learned
      Camden from obscurity. He is\r\n  represented kneeling, in his proper habit.
      He died in 1601.\r\n\r\n  _The Tombs in the open parts of the Abbey._\r\n\r\n
      \ 1. At the corner of the last mentioned chapel is a plain neat monument\r\n
      \ to the memory of Mr. Dryden, adorned with no other ornaments than an\r\n  elegant
      bust of that great poet. It was erected by the late Duke of\r\n  Buckingham,
      who thought no inscription necessary to transmit the fame\r\n  of that great
      poet to posterity; we therefore only see these few\r\n  words, J. DRYDEN, born
      1632, died May 1, 1700, and underneath, John\r\n  Sheffield Duke of Buckinghamshire
      erected this monument, 1720.\r\n\r\n  2. High on a pillar is a neat table monument
      to the memory of Mrs.\r\n  Martha Birch, who died in 1723, in the fiftieth year
      of her age. The\r\n  inscription also informs us, that she was daughter to Francis
      Viner,\r\n  Esq; and was first married to Francis Millington, Esq; and after
      his\r\n  death to Peter Birch, Prebendary of this Abbey; and that she was\r\n
      \ pious, chaste, and prudent.\r\n\r\n  3. At a small distance is a plain neat
      monument, to the memory of\r\n  Abraham Cowley, on which is placed a flaming
      urn, begirt with a\r\n  chaplet of laurel; expressive emblems of the glory he
      acquired by the\r\n  spirit of his writings. The Latin inscription and epitaph
      on the\r\n  pedestal have been thus translated.\r\n\r\n  Near this place lies
      ABRAHAM COWLEY, the Pindar, Horace, and Virgil of\r\n  England; and the delight,
      ornament, and admiration of this age.\r\n\r\n            While, sacred bard,
      far worlds thy works proclaim,\r\n            And you survive in an immortal
      fame,\r\n            Here may you bless\u2019d in pleasing quiet lie,\r\n            To
      guard thy urn may hoary Faith stand by;\r\n            And all thy favourite
      tuneful Nine repair\r\n            To watch thy dust with a perpetual care.\r\n
      \           Sacred for ever may this place be made,\r\n            And may no
      desperate hand presume t\u2019 invade\r\n            With touch unhallow\u2019d,
      this religious room,\r\n            Or dare affront thy venerable tomb;\r\n
      \           Unmov\u2019d and undisturb\u2019d till time shall end.\r\n            May
      Cowley\u2019s dust this marble shrine defend.\r\n\r\n      So wishes, and desires
      that wish may be sacred to posterity,\r\n      George Duke of Buckingham, who
      erected this monument for that\r\n      incomparable man. He died in the forty-ninth
      year of his age,\r\n      and was carried from Buckingham-house, with honourable
      pomp,\r\n      his exequies being attended by persons of illustrious\r\n      characters
      of all degrees, and interred August 13, 1667.\r\n\r\n  His grave is just before
      the monument, as appears by a blue stone, on\r\n  which is engraved his name.\r\n\r\n
      \ 4. The monument of that ancient poet Geoffery Chaucer, was once a\r\n  handsome
      one in the Gothic stile; but is now defaced by time. Chaucer,\r\n  who is stiled
      the Father of the English poets, was the son of Sir John\r\n  Chaucer, a citizen
      of London, employed by Edward III. in negociations\r\n  abroad relating to trade.
      He was first a student at Cambridge; but\r\n  afterwards studied at Merton College,
      Oxford; and to perfect himself\r\n  in the knowledge of the laws, entered himself
      of the Middle Temple:\r\n  thus accomplished, he soon became a favourite at
      court, and was\r\n  employed as shield-bearer to the King; was a gentleman of
      the\r\n  bedchamber, and by Edward III. was sent Embassador abroad. However,
      in\r\n  the succeeding reign he fell into disgrace, and was committed to the\r\n
      \ Tower for high-treason, where he wrote his Testament of Love: but upon\r\n
      \ the death of Richard II. he became a greater favourite at court than\r\n  ever,
      from his having married the great John of Gaunt\u2019s wife\u2019s sister.\r\n
      \ He was born in 1328, and died in 1400.\r\n\r\n  5. The plain monument of Mr.
      John Phillips, has his bust in relief,\r\n  represented as in an arbour, interwoven
      with vines, laurel branches,\r\n  and apple-trees; and over it this motto, _Honos
      erit huic quoque\r\n  pomo_, alluding to the high qualities ascribed to the
      apple, in his\r\n  excellent poem called _Cyder_. He was author of but few pieces;
      but\r\n  those were masterly performances. His Blenheim, Splendid Shilling,
      and\r\n  Lyric Ode to Lord Bolingbroke on Tobacco, have been much admired. He\r\n
      \ was the son of Dr. Stephen Phillips, Archdeacon of Salop, was born at\r\n
      \ Brampton in Oxfordshire on the 30th of December 1676, and died of a\r\n  consumption
      at Hereford, on the 15th of February, 1708, in the prime\r\n  of his life. The
      inscription on his monument contains an account of\r\n  his virtues and abilities,
      and is the strongest testimony of his\r\n  merit, since that alone could inspire
      his great patron Sir Simon\r\n  Harcourt, Knt. with such a generous friendship
      for him, as to\r\n  countenance and encourage him in the amplest manner when
      living; and\r\n  to extend his regard for him even after his death, by erecting
      this\r\n  monument to his memory.\r\n\r\n  6. Next this is Mr. Michael Drayton\u2019s
      monument. This gentleman was\r\n  esteemed an excellent poet, and learned antiquarian.
      The inscription\r\n  and epitaph were formerly in gold letters; but are now
      almost\r\n  obliterated, and are as follow:\r\n\r\n              MICHAEL DRAYTON,
      Esq; a memorable Poet of his\r\n             Age, exchanged his Laurel for a
      Crown of Glory,\r\n                                Anno 1631.\r\n\r\n                Do,
      pious marble! let thy Readers know\r\n                  What they, and what
      their Children owe\r\n                  To Drayton\u2019s Name, whose sacred
      dust\r\n                  We recommend unto thy trust;\r\n                Protect
      his mem\u2019ry and preserve his story;\r\n                Remain a lasting
      Monument of his Glory;\r\n                  And when thy Ruins shall disclaim\r\n
      \                 To be the Treasurer of his Name:\r\n                  His
      Name, that cannot fade, shall be\r\n                An everlasting Monument
      to thee.\r\n\r\n  7. Ben Johnson\u2019s monument is of white marble, and his
      bust is executed\r\n  with great happiness and spirit; \u2019tis inclosed with
      a tablature\r\n  ornamented with a few proper and elegant decorations, consisting
      of\r\n  emblematical figures: and has no other inscription but the words O\r\n
      \ RARE BEN JOHNSON! This gentleman was the son of a clergyman, and\r\n  educated
      at Westminster school, while Mr. Camden was Master; but after\r\n  his father\u2019s
      death, his mother marrying a bricklayer, he was forced\r\n  from school, and
      being obliged to work for his father, \u2019tis said, that\r\n  at the building
      of Lincoln\u2019s Inn, he was sometimes seen at work with\r\n  his trowel in
      one hand, and Horace in the other. However, Mr. Camden\r\n  having an esteem
      for him on account of his abilities, recommended him\r\n  to Sir Walter Raleigh.
      He attended that brave man\u2019s son in his\r\n  travels, and upon his return,
      entered himself at Cambridge; afterwards\r\n  he wrote a considerable number
      of plays; became Poet Laureat to King\r\n  James I. and died on the 16th of
      August 1637, aged 63. His tomb was\r\n  erected by the Earl of Essex, who has
      inscribed his own name on the\r\n  stone.\r\n\r\n  8. Spenser\u2019s tomb is
      of grey marble, and has suffered greatly by time.\r\n  It was erected in an
      age when taste was in its infancy in England, and\r\n  yet has something in
      it venerably plain, and not absurdly ornamental.\r\n  The inscription upon it
      is as follows:\r\n\r\n      Here lies (expecting the second coming of our Saviour
      Christ\r\n      Jesus) the Body of Edmund Spenser, the Prince of Poets in his\r\n
      \     time, whose divine Spirit needs no other witness than the\r\n      works
      he left behind him. He was born in London in 1510, and\r\n      died 1596.\r\n\r\n
      \ 9. Above Spenser\u2019s monument is that of Samuel Butler, the author of\r\n
      \ Hudibrass. By the Latin inscription, it appears, that it was erected\r\n  by
      John Barber, Esq; Citizen of London, and afterwards Lord Mayor in\r\n  1731,
      that he who was destitute of all things when alive, might not\r\n  want a monument
      when dead. Mr. Butler was born at Shernsham in\r\n  Worcestershire in 1612,
      and died at London in 1680.\r\n\r\n  10. A plain and neat monument of white
      marble in memory of that divine\r\n  poet, John Milton, who died in 1674. Under
      a very elegant bust made by\r\n  Rysbrack is this inscription:\r\n\r\n      In
      the year of our Lord Christ 1737, this bust of the author\r\n      of _Paradise
      Lost_ was placed here by William Benson, Esq; one\r\n      of the two auditors
      of the imprest to his Majesty, &c.\r\n\r\n  11. A monument erected to the memory
      of Thomas Shadwell, is adorned\r\n  with his bust crowned with a chaplet of
      bays, an urn, and other\r\n  decorations. It was erected to his honour by his
      son Dr. Thomas\r\n  Shadwell, and the Latin inscription informs us, that he
      was descended\r\n  from an ancient family in Staffordshire; was Poet Laureat
      and\r\n  Historiographer in the reign of King William, and died November 20,\r\n
      \ 1692, in the fifty-fifth year of his age. This poet was the author of\r\n
      \ several plays; but falling under the lash of Mr. Dryden, was satirized\r\n
      \ by him under the character of Ogg, in the second part of his Absalom\r\n  and
      Achitophel.\r\n\r\n  12. The monument of Matthew Prior, is adorned with great
      expence. On\r\n  one side of the pedestal stands the figure of Thalia, one of
      the\r\n  Muses, with a flute in her hand; and on the other History, with her\r\n
      \ book shut; between these statues is Prior\u2019s bust upon a raised altar,\r\n
      \ and over it is a handsome pediment, on the ascending sides of which\r\n  are
      two boys, one with an hour-glass in his hand run out; the other\r\n  holding
      a torch reversed. On the apex of the pediment is an urn, and\r\n  on the base
      of the monument is a long inscription in Latin, mentioning\r\n  the public posts
      and employments with which he had been intrusted; and\r\n  above we are informed,
      that while he was writing the history of his\r\n  own times, death interposed,
      and broke both the thread of his\r\n  discourse and of his life, on the 18th
      of September 1721, in the\r\n  fifty-seventh year of his age.\r\n\r\n  13. The
      monument of St. Evremond is a very plain one, adorned with a\r\n  bust. The
      inscription observes, that he was of a noble family in\r\n  Normandy, and was
      employed in the army of France, in which he rose to\r\n  the rank of a Marshal;
      but returning to Holland, was from thence\r\n  invited by King Charles II. into
      England, where he lived in the\r\n  greatest intimacy with the King and principal
      nobility; more\r\n  particularly with the Duchess of Mazarine. He was of a very
      sprightly\r\n  turn of humour, as well in his conversation as writings, and
      lived to\r\n  the age of ninety, when he was carried off by a fit of the strangury,\r\n
      \ on the 9th of September 1703.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _S. Wale delin._
      _C. Grignion sc._ _Monument of\r\n  Shakespear_]\r\n\r\n\r\n  14. The monument
      erected to the memory of the immortal Shakespear, a\r\n  print of which we have
      here given, is worthy of that great dramatic\r\n  writer, and both the design
      and execution are extremely elegant. Upon\r\n  a handsome pedestal stands his
      statue in white marble in the habit of\r\n  the time in which he lived, with
      one elbow leaning upon some books,\r\n  and his head reclined upon his hand,
      in a posture of meditation. The\r\n  attitude, the dress, the shape, the genteel
      air, and fine composure\r\n  observable in this figure of Shakespear, cannot
      be sufficiently\r\n  admired, and the beautiful lines of his upon the scroll
      are happily\r\n  chosen.\r\n\r\n               The cloud-cap\u2019d towers,
      the gorgeous palaces,\r\n               The solemn temples, the great globe
      itself;\r\n               Yea, all which it inherits, shall dissolve,\r\n               And
      like the baseless fabric of a vision,\r\n               Leave not a wreck behind.\r\n\r\n
      \ Immediately over his head upon a curious piece of dark-coloured\r\n  marble,
      is the following inscription, in capital letters raised in\r\n  gold:\r\n\r\n
      \                          GULIELMO SHAKESPEAR\r\n                         ANNO
      POST MORTEM CXXIV.\r\n                          AMOR PUBLICUS POSUIT.\r\n\r\n
      \ The heads on the pedestal representing Henry V. Richard III. and Queen\r\n
      \ Elizabeth, three principal characters in his plays, are likewise\r\n  proper
      ornaments to grace his tomb. In short, the taste that is here\r\n  shewn, does
      honour to those great names under whose direction, by the\r\n  public favour,
      it was so elegantly constructed; these were the Earl of\r\n  Burlington, Dr.
      Mead, Mr. Pope, and Mr. Martin. It was designed by\r\n  Kent, and executed by
      Scheemakers; and the expence defrayed by the\r\n  grateful contributions of
      the public.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Fleetwood, then Master of Drury Lane Theatre, and Mr.
      Rich of\r\n  Covent Garden, gave each a benefit, arising from one of his own
      plays,\r\n  towards it, and the Dean and Chapter made a present of the ground.\r\n\r\n
      \ 15. The next monument is a very fine one to the memory of Nicholas\r\n  Rowe,
      Esq; and his only daughter. On a pedestal about twenty inches\r\n  high, which
      stands on an altar, is a fine bust of Mr. Rowe; near it is\r\n  his Lady in
      the deepest affliction, and between both, on a pyramid\r\n  behind, is a medalion,
      with the head of a young Lady in relief. On the\r\n  front of the pedestal is
      this inscription:\r\n\r\n      To the memory of Nicholas Rowe, Esq; who died
      in 1718, aged\r\n      forty-five, and of Charlotte his only daughter, wife
      of Henry\r\n      Fane, Esq; who inheriting her father\u2019s spirit, and amiable
      in\r\n      her own innocence and beauty, died in the 23d year of her age,\r\n
      \     1739.\r\n\r\n  Underneath upon the front of the altar are these lines:\r\n\r\n
      \            Thy reliques, Rowe! to this sad shrine we trust,\r\n             And
      near thy Shakespear place thy honoured bust.\r\n             Oh! skill\u2019d,
      next him, to draw the tender tear,\r\n             For never heart felt passion
      more sincere:\r\n\r\n             To nobler sentiments to fire the brave,\r\n
      \            For never Briton more disdain\u2019d a slave!\r\n             Peace
      to thy gentle shade, and endless rest,\r\n             Blest in thy genius,
      in thy love too blest!\r\n             And blest, that timely from our scene
      remov\u2019d,\r\n             Thy soul enjoys that liberty it lov\u2019d.\r\n\r\n
      \            To these so mourn\u2019d in death, so lov\u2019d in life,\r\n             The
      childless Mother, and the widow\u2019d Wife,\r\n             With tears inscribes
      this monumental stone,\r\n             That holds their ashes, and expects her
      own.\r\n\r\n  16. Near this last, is a fine monument erected to the memory of
      Mr.\r\n  John Gay, by the Duke and Duchess of Queensberry, his great patrons.\r\n
      \ His bust is a very good one, and the masks, instruments of music, and\r\n
      \ other devices, are blended together in a group, in allusion to the\r\n  various
      species of writings in which he excelled, as farce, satire,\r\n  fable, and
      pastoral. The short epitaph in the front, was written by\r\n  himself, and has
      given some offence, as the sentiment at first view\r\n  seems by no means proper
      for a monument;\r\n\r\n                  Life is a jest, and all things shew
      it:\r\n                  I thought so once, but now I know it.\r\n\r\n  Underneath
      are these lines:\r\n\r\n               Of manners gentle, of affections mild;\r\n
      \              In wit, a man; simplicity, a child;\r\n               With native
      humour temp\u2019ring virtuous rage,\r\n               Form\u2019d to delight,
      at once, and lash the age:\r\n               Above temptation in a low estate,\r\n
      \              And uncorrupted, ev\u2019n among the great.\r\n               A
      safe companion, and an easy friend;\r\n               Unblam\u2019d thro\u2019
      life, lamented in thy end.\r\n               These are thy honours; not that
      here thy bust\r\n               Is mix\u2019d with Heroes, or with Kings thy
      dust;\r\n               But that the Worthy and the Good shall say,\r\n               Striking
      their pensive bosoms\u2014Here lies Gay.\r\n                                                    A.
      POPE.\r\n\r\n  Here lie the ashes of Mr. John Gay, the warmest friend, the gentlest\r\n
      \ companion, the most benevolent man; who maintained independency in low\r\n
      \ circumstances of fortune; integrity, in the midst of a corrupt age;\r\n  and
      that equal serenity of mind, which conscious goodness alone can\r\n  give, throughout
      the whole course of his life. Favourite of the Muses,\r\n  he was led by them
      to every elegant art, refined in taste, and fraught\r\n  with graces all his
      own. In various kinds of poetry, superior to many,\r\n  inferior to none: his
      works continue to inspire what his example\r\n  taught; contempt of folly, however
      adorned; detestation of vice,\r\n  however dignified; reverence of virtue, however
      disgraced.\r\n\r\n      Charles and Catharine, Duke and Duchess of Queensberry,
      who\r\n      loved his person living, and regret him dead, have caused this\r\n
      \     monument to be erected to his memory.\r\n\r\n  17. The next is a most
      magnificent, lofty and elegant monument,\r\n  erected to the late Duke of Argyle,
      enclosed with rails, and decorated\r\n  with figures finely executed. The statue
      of the Duke is spirited even\r\n  at the verge of life. On one side of the base
      is Pallas, and on the\r\n  other Eloquence; the one looking sorrowfully up at
      the principal\r\n  figure above, and the other pathetically displaying the public
      loss at\r\n  his death. Above is the figure of History, with one hand holding
      a\r\n  book, and with the other writing on a pyramid of most beautiful\r\n  variegated
      marble, admirably polished, the name and titles of the Hero\r\n  in large gold
      letters, JOHN DUKE OF ARGYLE AND GR. at which point the\r\n  pen of History
      rests. His actions are supposed to be contained in the\r\n  book she holds in
      her other hand, on the cover of which in letters of\r\n  gold are inscribed
      the date of his Grace\u2019s death, and the years of his\r\n  life. Above is
      inscribed on this beautiful pyramid in gold letters,\r\n  the following epitaph,
      said to be written by Paul Whitehead, Esq;\r\n\r\n             Britain, behold,
      if patriot worth be dear,\r\n             A shrine that claims thy tributary
      tear:\r\n             Silent that tongue admiring Senates heard:\r\n             Nerveless
      that arm opposing legions fear\u2019d:\r\n             Nor less, O Campbell!
      thine the pow\u2019r to please,\r\n             And give to grandeur all the
      grace of ease.\r\n             Long from thy life let kindred heroes trace\r\n
      \            Arts which ennoble still the noblest race.\r\n             Others
      may owe their future fame to me,\r\n             I borrow immortality from thee.\r\n\r\n
      \ On the base of the monument is this inscription:\r\n\r\n      In memory of
      an honest man, a constant friend, JOHN the Great\r\n      Duke of Argyle and
      Greenwich, a General and Orator exceeded by\r\n      none in the age he lived.
      Sir Henry Fermer, Baronet, by his\r\n      last will left the sum of five hundred
      pounds towards erecting\r\n      this monument, and recommended the above inscription.\r\n\r\n
      \ 19. The monument of Isaac Barrow, D.D. is remarkable for a fine bust\r\n  of
      that great divine and mathematician, who, as the inscription shews,\r\n  was
      Chaplain to King Charles II. Head of Trinity College, Cambridge;\r\n  Professor
      of Geometry at Gresham College in London, and of Greek and\r\n  Mathematics
      at Cambridge. He died on the 14th of May 1677, aged\r\n  forty-seven.\r\n\r\n
      \ 19. A table monument of white marble, erected to the memory of Sir\r\n  Richard
      Cox, who was taster to Queen Elizabeth, and King James I. and\r\n  to the latter
      steward of the household.\r\n\r\n  20. A neat monument erected to the memory
      of the learned Isaac\r\n  Casaubon, by Dr. Moreton, Bishop of Durham. That profound
      scholar and\r\n  critic whose name is inscribed upon it, was born in France,
      and in his\r\n  younger years was keeper of the royal library at Paris; but
      at length\r\n  being dissatisfied with the Romish religion, he, upon the murder
      of\r\n  his great patron Henry IV. quitted his native country, and at the\r\n
      \ earnest entreaty of King James I. settled in England, where he died in\r\n
      \ 1614, aged forty-five.\r\n\r\n  21. Above this last monument, is another for
      John Earnest Grape, a\r\n  person well skilled in oriental learning, who is
      represented as large\r\n  as the life, sitting in a thoughtful posture upon
      a marble tomb, as if\r\n  contemplating on death.\r\n\r\n  22. Next to the west
      corner of the south cross is an ancient monument\r\n  to the memory of that
      great antiquarian William Camden, who is\r\n  represented in a half length,
      in the dress of his time, holding a book\r\n  in his right hand, and in his
      left his gloves. He rests on an altar,\r\n  on the body of which is a Latin
      inscription, which mentions his\r\n  indefatigable industry in illustrating
      the British antiquities, and\r\n  his candour, sincerity, and pleasant good
      humour in private life. He\r\n  died Nov. 9, 1623.\r\n\r\n  In this south cross
      are several stones to be met with on the pavement,\r\n  worthy of notice. Among
      these is one over the body of Thomas Parr, of\r\n  the county of Salop, born
      in 1483. He lived in the reigns of ten\r\n  Princes, King Edward IV. King Edward
      V. King Richard III. King Henry\r\n  VII. King Henry VIII. King Edward VI. Queen
      Mary, Queen Elizabeth,\r\n  King James I. and King Charles I. and was interred
      here Nov. 15, 1635,\r\n  aged an hundred and fifty-two.\r\n\r\n  At a small
      distance from Parr, is a small white stone, over the body\r\n  of Sir William
      Davenant, who succeeded Ben Johnson as Poet Laureat to\r\n  King Charles I.
      and died in 1688, aged sixty-three. On this stone is\r\n  inscribed O RARE SIR
      WILLIAM DAVENANT! and this probably gave the\r\n  thought of putting the like
      inscription on the monument afterwards\r\n  erected to his predecessor Ben Johnson.\r\n\r\n
      \ Under the pavement near Dryden\u2019s tomb, lie the remains of Francis\r\n
      \ Beaumont, the dramatic writer, who died in London in March, 1615, and\r\n
      \ was buried here without either tomb or inscription.\r\n\r\n  Affixed to the
      pillars in this south cross, are also two table\r\n  monuments; which we shall
      but just mention, one for Samuel Barton,\r\n  D.D. a Prebendary of this church,
      who died in Sept. 1715, aged\r\n  sixty-two: and the other to the memory of
      Anthony Horneck, D.D. who\r\n  was born at Wittenberg in Zealand, but was educated
      at Oxford, and\r\n  became King\u2019s Divinity Professor and Chaplain, a Prebendary
      of this\r\n  church, and a Preacher at the Savoy. This gentleman, who was\r\n
      \ remarkable for his piety, died of the stone on the 30th of January,\r\n  1696,
      aged fifty-six.\r\n\r\n  23. On entering the south side, there is next the wall
      a monument\r\n  erected to the memory of Sophia Fairholm, Countess of Anandale.
      It is\r\n  the representation of an ancient sepulchre, over which a stately\r\n
      \ edifice is raised, ornamented at the top with the family arms. She\r\n  died
      in the year 1716, aged forty-six; and the monumental inscription\r\n  informs
      us, that it was erected by her son the Marquis of Anandale, as\r\n  a mark of
      his duty and gratitude.\r\n\r\n  24. The monument of the brave Sir Cloudesly
      Shovel, who here appears a\r\n  very unmeaning figure, with a large stiff wig,
      reposing himself upon\r\n  velvet cushions under a canopy of state; and on the
      base is\r\n  represented in bas relief, the ship Association in which the Admiral\r\n
      \ last sailed, striking against a rock, with several others perishing at\r\n
      \ the same time, and at the top are two boys blowing trumpets.\r\n\r\n  This
      monument has been highly censured by all persons of taste, tho\u2019\r\n  it
      is erected to his memory at great expence, and even by his\r\n  Sovereign Queen
      Anne. The great Mr. Addison has justly exposed it in\r\n  the Spectators, and
      complains at this brave rough English Admiral\u2019s\r\n  being here represented
      by the figure of a beau; and also censures the\r\n  inscription, which instead
      of celebrating the many remarkable actions\r\n  he had performed in the service
      of his country, only informs us of the\r\n  manner of his death, from which
      it was impossible to reap any honour,\r\n  tho\u2019 it may excite our pity.
      The inscription is as follows:\r\n\r\n      Sir Cloudesly Shovel, Knt. Rear-Admiral
      of Great Britain, and\r\n      Admiral and Commander in chief of the fleet\u2014the
      just reward of\r\n      his long and faithful services. He was deservedly beloved
      of\r\n      his country, and esteemed, tho\u2019 dreaded by the enemy, who had\r\n
      \     often experienced his conduct and courage. Being ship-wrecked\r\n      on
      the rocks of Scylly, in his voyage from Toulon, the 22d of\r\n      October
      1707, at night, in the 57th year of his age. His fate\r\n      was lamented
      by all, but especially by the seafaring part of\r\n      the nation; to whom
      he was a generous patron, and a worthy\r\n      example. His body was flung
      on the shore, and buried with\r\n      others in the sand; but being soon after
      taken up, was placed\r\n      under this monument, which his royal Mistress
      had caused to be\r\n      erected to commemorate his steady loyalty and extraordinary\r\n
      \     virtues.\r\n\r\n  25. The monument of George Stepney, Esq; has his bust
      under a canopy,\r\n  and two naked boys weeping and holding handkerchiefs at
      their eyes.\r\n  This monument, though the materials are very rich, is allowed
      to be\r\n  void of design, and but poorly executed. The Latin inscriptions give\r\n
      \ an account of his virtues, his learning and abilities, and the many\r\n  negociations
      in which he was employed at foreign courts. He died at\r\n  Chelsea in 1706.\r\n\r\n
      \ 26. A lofty and much more elegant monument for George Churchill, whose\r\n
      \ merits are mentioned in a long Latin inscription, where it is said\r\n  that
      he was the second son of Sir Winston Churchill, of Dorsetshire,\r\n  Knt. and
      a not unworthy brother of John Duke of Marlborough: that he\r\n  was early trained
      to military affairs, and served with great honour by\r\n  sea and land, under
      King Charles II. King James II. King William III.\r\n  and Queen Anne: that
      he was Admiral of the English fleet, at the\r\n  burning of the French fleet
      at La Hogue, in King William\u2019s reign; and\r\n  for his bravery there, made
      one of the Commissioners of the Admiralty:\r\n  that in the succeeding reign
      he was made Admiral in chief, and died on\r\n  the 8th of May 1718, aged fifty-eight.\r\n\r\n
      \ 27. Near that of Churchill\u2019s, is a stately monument erected for Sir\r\n
      \ Palmes Fairborne. Two pyramids of black marble standing on cannon\r\n  balls,
      have two Moorish Emperors heads in profile on their tops; these\r\n  pyramids
      are adorned with relievos, on one Sir Palmes is shot while\r\n  viewing the
      enemy\u2019s lines before the town; and on the other is a\r\n  hearse and six
      horses bringing him off wounded to the castle. Above in\r\n  a lofty dome are
      the arms of the deceased, with this motto underneath,\r\n  TUTUS SI FORTIS,
      and over his arms a Turk\u2019s head on a dagger, by way\r\n  of crest, which
      he won by his valour in fighting against that people\r\n  in the German war.
      On this monument is the following inscription:\r\n\r\n      Sacred to the immortal
      memory of Sir Palmes Fairborne, Knt.\r\n      Governor of Tangier, in execution
      of which command, he was\r\n      mortally wounded by a shot from the Moors,
      then besieging the\r\n      town, in the 46th year of his age, October 24, 1680.\r\n\r\n
      \ His epitaph, wrote by Mr. Dryden, runs thus:\r\n\r\n           Ye sacred reliques,
      which your marble keep,\r\n           Here undisturb\u2019d by wars, in quiet
      sleep:\r\n           Discharge the trust, which (when it was below) }\r\n           Fairborne\u2019s
      undaunted soul did undergo,        }\r\n           And be the town\u2019s palladium
      from the foe.      }\r\n           Alive and dead these walls he will defend:\r\n
      \          Great actions great examples must attend.\r\n           The Candian
      siege his early valour knew,\r\n           Where Turkish blood did his young
      hands imbrue;\r\n           From thence returning, with deserv\u2019d applause,
      \    }\r\n           Against the Moors his well-flesh\u2019d sword he draws,
      }\r\n           The same the courage, and the same the cause.      }\r\n           His
      youth and age, his life and death combine,     }\r\n           As in some great
      and regular design,               }\r\n           All of a piece throughout,
      and all divine.         }\r\n           Still nearer heav\u2019n his virtue
      shone more bright,  }\r\n           Like rising flames expanding in their height,
      \     }\r\n           The martyr\u2019s glory crown\u2019d the soldier\u2019s
      fight.    }\r\n           More bravely British General never fell,\r\n           Nor
      General\u2019s death was e\u2019er reveng\u2019d so well,\r\n           Which
      his pleas\u2019d eyes beheld before their close,\r\n           Follow\u2019d
      by thousand victims of his foes.\r\n             To his lamented loss, for times
      to come,\r\n             His pious widow consecrates this tomb.\r\n\r\n  26.
      On a table monument enriched with military trophies, and raised\r\n  against
      the wall, is the following inscription:\r\n\r\n      To the memory of the honoured
      Major Richard Creed, who\r\n      attended his Majesty King William the Third
      in all his wars,\r\n      every where signalizing himself, and never more himself
      than\r\n      when he looked an enemy in the face. At the glorious battle of\r\n
      \     Blenheim, Ann. Dom. 1704, he commanded those squadrons that\r\n      began
      the attack; in two several charges he remained unhurt;\r\n      but in a third,
      after many wounds received, still valiantly\r\n      fighting, he was shot through
      the head. His dead body was\r\n      brought off by his brother, at the hazard
      of his own life, and\r\n      buried there. To his memory his sorrowful mother
      erects this\r\n      monument, placing it near another which her son, when living,\r\n
      \     used to look upon with pleasure, for the worthy mention it\r\n      makes
      of that great man Edward Earl of Sandwich, to whom he\r\n      had the honour
      to be related, and whose heroic virtues he was\r\n      ambitious to imitate.\r\n\r\n
      \ 27. The monument of Sir John Chardin, who distinguished himself by his\r\n
      \ travels into the east, is adorned with a globe, which exhibits a view\r\n
      \ of the different countries he visited, and around it are represented a\r\n
      \ number of geographical instruments.\r\n\r\n  28. The monument of Sidney Earl
      of Godolphin is adorned with a bust\r\n  richly dressed, and has an inscription
      which mentions the employments\r\n  and honours through which he passed. He
      died on September 15, 1712,\r\n  aged sixty-seven.\r\n\r\n  29. The next is
      a double monument erected to the memory of Sir Charles\r\n  Harbord, and Clement
      Cottrel, Esq; On the base is represented in\r\n  relievo a dreadful sea-fight,
      and on the top in a wreath of laurel is\r\n  this inscription, \u201CTo preserve
      and unite the memory of two faithful\r\n  friends, who lost their lives at sea
      together, May 28, 1672.\u201D These\r\n  two young gentlemen both perished in
      the Royal James, with the Earl of\r\n  Sandwich, who commanded in that ship
      as Vice-Admiral against the Dutch\r\n  in that memorable fight off the coast
      of Sussex in the reign of King\r\n  Charles II. The Royal James being set on
      fire, Sir Charles Harbord,\r\n  first Lieutenant, though he might have saved
      himself by swimming as\r\n  many others did, yet out of pure affection to his
      worthy Commander,\r\n  chose to die with him. Young Cottrel was a volunteer,
      and after being\r\n  the first man who had boarded a Dutch ship of 70 guns,
      and pulled down\r\n  her ensign with his own hands, returned to the Royal James
      unwounded,\r\n  and also perished with his friends. This gentleman understood
      seven\r\n  languages, tho\u2019 but twenty-two years of age. This moving story
      is\r\n  recited at large on the monument.\r\n\r\n  30. A tomb erected to the
      memory of Anne Fielding, the first wife of\r\n  Sir Samuel Morland, Knt. and
      Bart. chiefly remarkable for having two\r\n  very learned inscriptions: the
      first, in Hebrew, is to this effect:\r\n\r\n      O thou fairest among women!
      O virtuous woman! The hand of the\r\n      Lord hath done this.\r\n\r\n      The
      Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the\r\n      name of the
      Lord.\r\n\r\n  Under this is an Ethiopic inscription, which has been thus translated:\r\n\r\n
      \     Come let us lament over this monument, raised for thee by a\r\n      beloved
      husband; but in certain hope that thou art united with\r\n      Christ.\r\n\r\n
      \     This Lady was truly religious, virtuous, faithful, and, as a\r\n      dove,
      mild and chaste; while she continued in life, she was\r\n      honoured, and,
      through mercy, is happy in death.\r\n\r\n  Under the Ethiopic is this inscription
      in English:\r\n\r\n      Anne, daughter to George Fielding, Esq; and of Mary
      his wife,\r\n      the truly loving (and as truly beloved) wife of Samuel\r\n
      \     Morland, Knt. and Bart. died Feb. 20, Ann. Dom. 1679\u201380.\r\n\r\n
      \ 31. Near this last is a tomb much in the same taste, erected to the\r\n  memory
      of Carola Harsnet, the second wife of the same Baronet, who\r\n  died in child-bed
      of her second son, Oct. 10, 1674, in the 23d year of\r\n  her age. Here are
      two inscriptions, the first in Hebrew, and the other\r\n  in Greek, which have
      been thus translated:\r\n\r\n      Blessed be the Lord, my wife was precious:
      blessed be thy\r\n      remembrance, O virtuous woman.\r\n\r\n      When I think
      of thy mildness, patience, charity, modesty, and\r\n      piety, I lament thee,
      O most excellent creature, and grieve\r\n      exceedingly: but not like such
      as have no faith; for I believe\r\n      and expect the resurrection of those
      who sleep in Christ.\r\n\r\n  32. Between the two former is a beautiful monument
      to the memory of\r\n  John Smith, Esq; a fine bust in relievo of that gentleman,
      is\r\n  supported by a weeping figure representing his daughter, both which\r\n
      \ are designed and executed with great judgment and spirit. The Lady\r\n  sits
      upon an urn, which, with its base and a pyramid behind, unite the\r\n  whole
      in a most harmonious and agreeable stile. On the base is a Latin\r\n  inscription,
      setting forth his descent and issue.\r\n\r\n  33. Over the door that opens into
      the cloisters is a noble and elegant\r\n  monument erected for General Wade.
      In the center is a beautiful marble\r\n  pillar, enriched with military trophies
      most exquisitely wrought. The\r\n  principal figures, are Fame pushing back
      Time, who is eagerly\r\n  approaching to demolish the pillar, with all the ensigns
      of honour,\r\n  with which it is adorned; the General\u2019s head is in a medalion,
      and the\r\n  whole is executed with great beauty and elegance. The inscription\r\n
      \ underneath runs thus:\r\n\r\n      To the memory of George Wade, Field-Marshal
      of his Majesty\u2019s\r\n      forces, Lieutenant-General of the ordnance, Colonel
      of his\r\n      Majesty\u2019s third Regiment of Dragoon guards, Governor of\r\n
      \     Fort-William, Fort-Augustus, and Fort-George, and one of his\r\n      Majesty\u2019s
      most honourable Privy Council. He died March 14,\r\n      1748, aged seventy-five.\r\n\r\n
      \ 34. A plain neat monument erected to the memory of Robert Cannon, D.\r\n  D.
      Dean of Lincoln, and Prebendary of this church, who died on the\r\n  28th of
      March 1722, aged fifty-nine.\r\n\r\n  35. An elegant monument of Mrs. Katharine
      Bovey. Faith is here\r\n  represented with her book closed, and Wisdom lamenting
      the death of\r\n  her Patroness, between which is the Lady\u2019s head in relief
      enclosed in\r\n  an annulet of black marble curiously veined. The inscription,
      which is\r\n  in English, gives an excellent character of the deceased, who
      died on\r\n  the 21st of January 1726, in the seventy-second year of her age;
      and\r\n  informs us that Mrs. Mary Pope, who lived with her near forty years,\r\n
      \ in perfect friendship, erected this monument to her memory.\r\n\r\n  36. A
      small table monument to the memory of Mr. Henry Wharton, which\r\n  is only
      remarkable an account of the distinguished character of the\r\n  person whose
      name is inscribed upon it. Mr. Wharton was Rector of\r\n  Chartham in Kent,
      Vicar of the church of Minster in the Isle of\r\n  Thanet, Chaplain to Archbishop
      Sancroft, and one of the most\r\n  voluminous writers of his years. He died
      on the 3d of March 1694, aged\r\n  only thirty-one, and was so universally respected
      by the Bishops and\r\n  Clergy, that Archbishop Tillotson, and several other
      prelates, with a\r\n  vast body of the clergy, the choir and King\u2019s scholars,
      all in solemn\r\n  procession attended his funeral, and joined in an anthem
      composed on\r\n  this occasion by the great Purcell.\r\n\r\n  37. A plain neat
      monument erected to the memory of Dr. Thomas Spratt,\r\n  Bishop of Rochester,
      who died in 1713, aged seventy seven, and of his\r\n  son Mr. Thomas Spratt,
      Archdeacon of Rochester, and Prebendary of the\r\n  churches of Rochester, Winchester,
      and Westminster, whose remains lie\r\n  near those of his father. This monument
      was erected by John Friend, M.\r\n  D. as a testimony of his respect for those
      two worthy personages.\r\n\r\n  38. A monument for Sir Lumley Robinson, Bart.
      of Kentwell-Hall in\r\n  Suffolk, who by an untimely death ended his life Aug.
      6, 1684, aged\r\n  thirty-six. It is adorned with columns supported by death\u2019s
      heads, and\r\n  the arms upon the base by a cherub. The sides of the pediment
      have\r\n  enrichments of laurel branches, &c. and on the top is a vase.\r\n\r\n
      \ 39. The monument of John Friend, M. D. has an admirable bust of that\r\n  gentleman,
      standing on a pedestal of fine white veined marble, and\r\n  under it is a long
      inscription in Latin, setting forth the\r\n  distinguished acquirements, and
      great abilities of that eminent\r\n  physician.\r\n\r\n  40. Mr. Congreve\u2019s
      monument has an half length marble portrait of that\r\n  gentleman, placed on
      a pedestal of fine Egyptian marble, and enriched\r\n  with emblematical devices
      relating to the drama. Underneath is this\r\n  inscription in English:\r\n\r\n
      \     Mr. William Congreve died January 19, 1728, aged fifty-six,\r\n      and
      was buried near this place. To whose most valuable memory\r\n      this monument
      is set up by Henrietta Duchess of Marlborough,\r\n      as a mark how dearly
      she remembers the happiness she enjoyed\r\n      in the sincere friendship of
      so worthy and honest a man; whose\r\n      virtue, candour and wit, gained him
      the love and esteem of the\r\n      present age; and whose writings will be
      the admiration of the\r\n      future.\r\n\r\n  41. The monument of the Right
      Hon. James Craggs, Esq; his statue is\r\n  represented leaning on an urn, and
      was one of the first in the Abbey\r\n  represented standing. The inscription,
      which is in golden characters,\r\n  shews that he was Principal Secretary of
      state, and a man universally\r\n  beloved, which is there particularly remarked,
      because as he was only\r\n  a shoe-maker\u2019s son, it is the more surprizing
      that in the high station\r\n  to which he was raised by his merit, he should
      escape envy, and\r\n  acquire the general esteem. He died on the 16th of February
      1720. Upon\r\n  the base of this monument are the following lines, written by
      Mr.\r\n  Pope:\r\n\r\n             Statesman, yet friend to truth, of soul sincere,\r\n
      \            In action faithful, and in honour clear!\r\n             Who broke
      no promise, serv\u2019d no private end;\r\n             Who gain\u2019d no title,
      and who lost no friend;\r\n             Ennobled by himself, by all approved;\r\n
      \            Prais\u2019d, wept, and honour\u2019d by the Muse he lov\u2019d.\r\n\r\n\r\n
      \ [Illustration: _S. Wale delin_ _C. Grignion sc._ _Cap^t. Cornwall\u2019s\r\n
      \ Monument_]\r\n\r\n\r\n  42. On the south side of the great west entrance is
      a noble monument\r\n  erected to the memory of the brave Captain Cornwall, who
      after\r\n  distinguishing himself by his heroism, was unhappily slain in the\r\n
      \ battle between the English fleet, commanded by the Admirals Matthews\r\n  and
      Lestock, and the French. This monument was erected to his honour\r\n  by order
      of Parliament, and is a noble testimony of the public\r\n  gratitude for his
      distinguished merit. On the back is a lofty pyramid\r\n  of Egyptian marble
      beautifully variegated, and finely polished,\r\n  standing on a base of the
      same marble. Upon this base is a rock of\r\n  white marble, along the different
      parts of which run sea weeds. Near\r\n  the top stands a fine figure of Fame,
      placing a medalion of the\r\n  Captain on the summit of the rock, underneath
      which is a naval crown,\r\n  a globe, the trumpet of Fame, and other ornaments,
      and behind rises to\r\n  the top of the pediment a palm, entwined with a laurel.
      On the other\r\n  side of the medalion stands a beautiful figure of Britannia,
      with the\r\n  British Lion couchant at her feet. Beneath, in an opening of the
      rock,\r\n  is a Latin inscription on a fine piece of polished porphyry,\r\n
      \ mentioning his descent, and the manner of his death, which happened\r\n  while
      fighting for his country, on the 3d of February 1743, in the\r\n  45th year
      of his age, and that the Senate of Britain consecrated this\r\n  monument to
      his memory. In another opening of the rock, a little\r\n  lower, is represented
      in bass relief a view of the engagement in which\r\n  this great man perished,
      and at the bottom of the rock on the sides\r\n  lie cannons, flags, anchors,
      &c. all of white marble.\r\n\r\n  43. The next is an elegant monument for Sir
      Thomas Hardy, Knt. On the\r\n  back is a lofty pyramid of a bluish coloured
      marble, at the foot of\r\n  which the statue of the deceased is placed, reclining
      upon a tomb of\r\n  elegant workmanship, with a naked boy on his left side weeping
      over an\r\n  urn: the enrichments round the pedestal on which he stands are
      just\r\n  and proper; and the inscription contains the following short history\r\n
      \ of his life:\r\n\r\n      Sir THOMAS HARDY, to whose memory this monument
      is erected,\r\n      was bred in the royal navy from his youth, and was made
      a\r\n      Captain in 1693.\r\n\r\n      In the expedition to Cadiz, under Sir
      George Rooke, he\r\n      commanded the Pembroke; and when the fleet left the
      coast of\r\n      Spain, to return to England, he was ordered to Lagos Bay,\r\n
      \     where he got intelligence of the Spanish galleons being\r\n      arrived
      in the harbour of Vigo, under convoy of seventeen\r\n      French men of war:
      by his great diligence and judgment he\r\n      joined the English fleet, and
      gave the Admiral that\r\n      intelligence which engaged him to make the best
      of his way to\r\n      Vigo, where all the aforementioned galleons and men of
      war\r\n      were either taken or destroyed.\r\n\r\n      After the success
      of that action, the Admiral sent him with an\r\n      account of it to the Queen,
      who ordered him a considerable\r\n      present, and knighted him.\r\n\r\n      Some
      years afterwards he was made a Rear-Admiral, and received\r\n      several other
      marks of favour and esteem from her Majesty, and\r\n      from her Royal Consort
      Prince George of Denmark, Lord High\r\n      Admiral of England.\r\n\r\n  44.
      The monument of John Conduit, Esq; is allowed, in point of design,\r\n  to be
      not inferior to that last mentioned, and there is something in\r\n  the manner
      which shews them both to be the workmanship of the same\r\n  hand. In the middle
      of the pyramid is a large medalion of brass, round\r\n  which is a Latin inscription,
      thus english\u2019d, JOHN CONDUIT, MASTER OF\r\n  THE MINT; this medalion is
      suspended by a cherub above, and rests on\r\n  another below. This gentleman
      succeeded his relation the great Sir\r\n  Isaac Newton in that office, and desired
      to be interred near him, as\r\n  appears from a long Latin inscription on the
      base. He died May 23d,\r\n  1727, aged forty-nine. Catharine his wife died Jan.
      20, 1739, and lies\r\n  interred under the same tomb.\r\n\r\n  45. The monument
      of William Horneck, Esq; is enriched with books,\r\n  plans, and instruments
      of fortification, alluding to the employments\r\n  of the deceased; who was
      chief engineer to the royal train of\r\n  artillery, and, as his inscription
      informs us, learned the art of war\r\n  under the great Duke of Marlborough.
      He died May 10, 1743.\r\n\r\n  46. The monument of Sir Godfrey Kneller, Knt.
      has a bust of Sir\r\n  Godfrey under a canopy of state, the curtains of which
      are gilt and\r\n  tied with golden strings, and on each side the bust is a weeping\r\n
      \ Cupid, one resting on a framed picture, the other holding a painter\u2019s\r\n
      \ pallat and pencils. This monument is not however much esteemed.\r\n\r\n  On
      the pedestal is a Latin inscription, signifying that Sir Godfrey\r\n  Kneller,
      Knt. who lies interred here, was painter to King Charles II.\r\n  King James
      II. King William III. Queen Anne, and King George I.\r\n  Underneath is his
      epitaph written by Mr. Pope, which has been also\r\n  much censured:\r\n\r\n
      \            Kneller! by Heav\u2019n, and not a master taught!\r\n             Whose
      art was nature, and whose pictures thought;\r\n             Now for two ages
      having snatch\u2019d from fate\r\n             Whate\u2019er was beauteous,
      or whate\u2019er was great,\r\n             Rests crown\u2019d with Princes\u2019
      honours, Poets\u2019 lays,\r\n             Due to his merit, and brave thirst
      of praise.\r\n             Living, great Nature fear\u2019d he might outvie\r\n
      \            Her works; and dying, fears herself may die.\r\n\r\n  47. We come
      now to the monument of Anna Countess Dowager of\r\n  Clanrikard, which is adorned
      with excellent carving, and a fine statue\r\n  of that Lady resting upon a tomb.
      The inscription gives an account of\r\n  her descent, marriages, and issue,
      and informs us, that she died on\r\n  the 14th of January 1732, in the 49th
      year of her age.\r\n\r\n  48. The monument of John Woodward, M. D. is a very
      beautiful one, and\r\n  the figures most admirably finished. The head of the
      deceased is\r\n  represented in profile, in a very masterly manner, and the
      Lady who\r\n  holds it is inimitably performed. The inscription contains a panegyric\r\n
      \ on the parts and learning of the deceas\u2019d.\r\n\r\n  49. A neat plain
      monument erected to the memory of Heneage Twisden, a\r\n  young hero, who fell
      in the battle of Blairgnies in Hainault, while he\r\n  was Aid de Camp to John
      Duke of Argyle, who commanded the right wing\r\n  of the Confederate army. He
      was the seventh son of Sir William\r\n  Twisden, Bart. and a youth of the greatest
      expectations; but the\r\n  fortune of war put a stop to his rising merit, in
      1709, and in the\r\n  29th year of his age.\r\n\r\n  Near this monument are
      two small ones to the memory of two of his\r\n  brothers, Josiah and John; Josiah
      was a Captain at the siege of\r\n  Agremont, near Lisle in Flanders, and was
      slain by a cannon shot in\r\n  1708, at twenty-three years of age. John was
      a Lieutenant in the\r\n  Admiral\u2019s ship, under Sir Cloudesly Shovel, and
      perished with him in\r\n  1707, aged twenty-three.\r\n\r\n  50. A monument erected
      in honour of Col. James Bringfield, ornamented\r\n  with military trophies,
      cherubs, &c. and surrounded by a mantling\r\n  enclosing a tablet, on which
      is inscribed the military preferments of\r\n  the deceased, the manner of his
      death and burial, and the praises of\r\n  his piety and virtue. He was born
      at Abingdon in Berks, was Equerry to\r\n  Prince George of Denmark, and Aid
      de Camp to the Great Duke of\r\n  Marlborough; but was killed by a cannon ball,
      as he was remounting his\r\n  General on a fresh horse, at the battle of Ramelies,
      May 12, 1706, and\r\n  was interred at Barechem in Brabant, in the 50th year
      of his age.\r\n\r\n  51. The monument of Mr. Killegrew has been reckoned one
      of the best\r\n  pieces of sculpture in the whole church, and what is remarkable,
      is\r\n  cut out of one stone. The embellishments are distinct and very\r\n  picturesque,
      and the inscription, short, modest, and soldier-like. It\r\n  is as follows:\r\n\r\n
      \     Robert Killegrew, of Arwenack in Cornwall, Esq; son of Thomas\r\n      and
      Charlotte, Page of honour to King Charles II. Brigadier\r\n      General of
      her Majesty\u2019s forces, killed in Spain in the battle\r\n      of Almanza,
      April 14, 1707. \xC6tatis fu\xE6 47. MILITAVI ANNIS 24.\r\n\r\n  52. The next
      is a monument erected to the memory of Mrs. Mary Beaufoy,\r\n  who is represented
      in a devout posture, with cherubs crowning her: on\r\n  each side are Cupids
      lamenting the early decay of a virgin beauty, and\r\n  underneath the arms of
      her family quarterly upheld by cherubs. On the\r\n  base is the following inscription:\r\n\r\n
      \     Reader! whoever thou art, let the sight of this tomb imprint\r\n      in
      thy mind, that the young and old without distinction, leave\r\n      this world;
      and therefore fail not to secure the next. This\r\n      Lady was only daughter
      and heiress to Sir Henry Beaufoy, of\r\n      Guyscliffe, near Warwick, by the
      Hon. Charlotte Lane, eldest\r\n      daughter of George Lord Viscount Lansborough.
      She died July\r\n      12, 1705.\r\n\r\n  53. After passing by a few monuments
      unworthy of notice, we come to\r\n  that of Admiral Baker, adorned with a rostral
      column of curiously\r\n  veined marble, decorated with the prows of galleys,
      a Medusa\u2019s head,\r\n  and other naval and military trophies, with this
      short inscription\r\n  underneath:\r\n\r\n      To the memory of John Baker,
      Esq; Vice-Admiral of the White\r\n      Squadron of the British Fleet; who,
      when he commanded in the\r\n      Mediterranean, died at Port Mahon, Nov. 10,
      1736, aged\r\n      fifty-six. He was a brave, judicious and experienced officer;\r\n
      \     a sincere friend, and a true lover of his country.\r\n\r\n        _Manet
      post Funera Virtus._\r\n\r\n  54. Next to this is Mr. Priestman\u2019s monument,
      to which is suspended by\r\n  a knot of ribbons, fastened to a column of variegated
      marble, a fine\r\n  medalion, with the words HENRY PRIESTMAN, Esq; round the
      head.\r\n  Underneath are naval trophies and sea instruments; and upon the base\r\n
      \ is an inscription, shewing that the person to whom this monument is\r\n  erected,
      was Commander in chief of a squadron of ships of war in the\r\n  reign of King
      Charles II. a Commissioner of the Navy, and one of the\r\n  Commissioners for
      executing the office of Lord High Admiral of England\r\n  in the reign of King
      William III. He died Aug. 20, 1712, aged 65.\r\n\r\n  55. The monument of Philip
      Carteret, son to Lord George Carteret, who\r\n  died a King\u2019s scholar at
      Westminster, ripe for the university, on the\r\n  19th of March 1710, aged nineteen.
      On the upper part is an admirable\r\n  bust of this noble youth, and underneath
      a very fine figure of Time\r\n  standing on an altar, and holding a scroll in
      his hand, whereon is\r\n  written in Sapphic verses, lines to the following
      import, which he is\r\n  supposed to be repeating:\r\n\r\n                Why
      flows the mournful Muse\u2019s tear,\r\n                  For thee! cut down
      in life\u2019s full prime?\r\n                Why sighs, for thee, the parent
      dear!\r\n                  Cropt by the scythe of hoary Time?\r\n\r\n                Lo!
      this, my Boy\u2019s the common lot!\r\n                  To me thy memory entrust;\r\n
      \               When all that\u2019s dear shall be forgot,\r\n                  I\u2019ll
      guard thy venerable dust.\r\n\r\n                From age to age, as I proclaim\r\n
      \                 Thy learning, piety, and truth;\r\n                Thy great
      example shall enflame;\r\n                  And emulation raise in youth.\r\n\r\n
      \ 56. A neat monument erected for Edward de Carteret, the son of Sir\r\n  Edward
      de Carteret, Gentleman Usher to King Charles II. who died on\r\n  the 30th of
      October 1677, in the eighth year of his age. It is\r\n  ornamented with cherubs
      and with festoons of leaves and fruit.\r\n\r\n  57. The monument of Thomas Levingston,
      Viscount Teviot, is decorated\r\n  with the arms, supporters, and crest of that
      nobleman, and with\r\n  military trophies, alluding to his profession of a soldier.
      On the\r\n  face of the monument is a long inscription in Latin, shewing that
      he\r\n  was born in Holland, but descended from the Levingstons in Scotland;\r\n
      \ that from his childhood he was trained to arms; and having attended\r\n  the
      Prince of Orange into Britain, as a Colonel of foot, rose to the\r\n  rank of
      a Lieutenant-General in the army, and General of the Scotch\r\n  forces, was
      made Master of the ordnance, and a Privy Counsellor; that\r\n  he secured Scotland
      to the King by one decisive action on the Spey,\r\n  for which he was advanced
      to the dignity of a Viscount, and that he\r\n  died on the 14th of Jan. 1710,
      aged sixty.\r\n\r\n  58. A handsome monument erected for the Lord Constable,
      ornamented\r\n  with a cherub below, and the family arms above. It has this
      short\r\n  inscription:\r\n\r\n      Near this lies the Right Hon. Robert Lord
      Constable, Viscount\r\n      Dunbar, who departed this life Nov. 23, 1714, in
      the\r\n      sixty-fourth year of his age.\r\n\r\n  59. A plain neat monument
      for Peter Heylin, D.D. and Prebendary of\r\n  this church, who died on the 8th
      of May 1662. It is adorned with a\r\n  pediment, and the arms of the deceased,
      and contains a long\r\n  inscription in Latin, mentioning the most remarkable
      incidents in his\r\n  life.\r\n\r\n  60. The tomb of Charles Williams, Esq;
      adorned with very remarkable\r\n  scroll-work, and scollopping; what is very
      singular is, its being\r\n  supported by a death\u2019s head on the wings of
      Time. This gentleman died\r\n  on the 29th of August 1720, aged eighty-seven.\r\n\r\n
      \ 61. A small but elegant monument erected to the memory of the\r\n  celebrated
      Henry Purcell, Esq; well known by his admirable musical\r\n  compositions. The
      inscription consists of this short and comprehensive\r\n  sentence:\r\n\r\n
      \              Here lies Henry Purcell, who left this life,\r\n                 and
      is gone to that blessed place, where\r\n                   only his harmony
      can be exceeded. He\r\n                  died Nov. 21, 1697, in his 37th year.\r\n\r\n
      \ 62. The next is the monument of William Croft, Doctor in music. On the\r\n
      \ pedestal is an organ in bas relief, and on the top, a bust of the\r\n  deceased,\r\n\r\n
      \ 63. The tomb of John Blow, Doctor in music, is adorned with cherubs,\r\n  flowers,
      and a canon in four parts set to music. In the center is an\r\n  English inscription,
      by which it appears he was organist, composer,\r\n  and master to the children
      in the chapel royal thirty-five years, and\r\n  organist to this Abbey fifteen
      years; that he was scholar to Dr.\r\n  Christopher Gibbons; and master to the
      famous Mr. Purcell, and to most\r\n  of the eminent masters of his time. He
      died Oct. 1. 1708, in his\r\n  sixtieth year; and his epitaph observes, that
      his own musical\r\n  compositions, especially his church music, are a far nobler
      monument\r\n  to his memory than any other that can be raised to him.\r\n\r\n
      \ 64. We come now to the neat and elegant monument erected to the memory\r\n
      \ of Dr. Boulter, Archbishop of Armagh in Ireland. It is of the finest\r\n  marble
      beautified with an admirable new invented polish. The bust of\r\n  this worthy
      Archbishop is finely executed; his long flowing hair has\r\n  all the gracefulness
      of nature, without the smallest degree of that\r\n  stiffness which belongs
      to stone; and his venerable countenance\r\n  strikes the beholder with reverence.
      The ensigns of his dignity\r\n  wherewith the monument is adorned, are most
      exquisitely fine, and\r\n  every part about it discovers a masterly genius in
      the sculptor. The\r\n  inscription is inclosed in a beautiful border of porphyry,
      and is as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n      Dr. Hugh Boulter, late Archbishop of Armagh,
      Primate of all\r\n      Ireland, a Prelate so eminent for the accomplishments
      of his\r\n      mind, the purity of his heart, and the excellence of his life,\r\n
      \     that it may be thought superfluous to specify his titles,\r\n      recount
      his virtues, or even erect a monument to his fame. His\r\n      titles he not
      only deserved, but adorned; his virtues are\r\n      manifest in his good works,
      which had never dazzled the public\r\n      eye, if they had not been too bright
      to be concealed; and as\r\n      to his fame, whosoever has any sense of merit,
      any reverence\r\n      for piety, any passion for his country, or any charity
      for\r\n      mankind, will assist in preserving it fair and spotless, that\r\n
      \     when brass and marble shall mix with the dust they cover,\r\n      every
      succeeding age may have the benefit of his illustrious\r\n      example. He
      was born Jan. 4, 1671, was consecrated Bishop of\r\n      Bristol, 1718, translated
      to the Archbishopric of Armagh,\r\n      1723, and from thence to Heaven, Sept.
      27, 1742.\r\n\r\n  65. A plain table monument erected to the memory of Dr. Samuel\r\n
      \ Bradford, Bishop of Rochester, who died on the 14th of May 1731, in\r\n  the
      seventy-ninth year of his age. It contains a long Latin\r\n  inscription scarce
      legible, surrounded with the arms, and proper\r\n  ensigns of his several dignities.\r\n\r\n
      \ 66. The next is a monument erected to the memory of Richard Kane, Esq;\r\n
      \ Governor of Minorca, adorned with a curious bust of that gentleman in\r\n
      \ white marble, placed upon a handsome pedestal, whereon are inscribed\r\n  the
      most remarkable passages of his life. He was born at Down in\r\n  Ireland, Dec.
      20, 1661. In 1689 he first appeared in a military\r\n  capacity at the memorable
      siege of Derry; and after the reduction of\r\n  Ireland, followed King William
      into Flanders, where he distinguished\r\n  himself, particularly by his intrepid
      behaviour at the siege of Namur,\r\n  where he was grievously wounded. In 1702,
      he bore a commission in the\r\n  service of Queen Anne, and assisted in the
      expedition to Canada; from\r\n  whence he again returned into Flanders, and
      fought under the Duke of\r\n  Argyle and Greenwich, and afterwards under Lord
      Carpenter. In 1712, he\r\n  was made Sub-Governor of Minorca, through which
      island he caused a\r\n  road to be made, which had been thought impracticable.
      In 1720 he was\r\n  ordered by King George I. to the defence of Gibraltar, where
      he\r\n  sustained an eight months siege against the Spaniards, when all hope\r\n
      \ of relief was extinguished. For which gallant service he was\r\n  afterwards,
      by King George II. rewarded with the government of\r\n  Minorca, where he died
      Dec. 19, 1736, and was buried in the castle of\r\n  St. Philip.\r\n\r\n  67.
      The monument of Percy Kirk, Esq; is adorned with a fine bust of\r\n  that gentleman,
      on each side of which is a winged seraph, one with a\r\n  dagger in his right
      hand inverted, and in his left a helmet; the other\r\n  resting on a ball, and
      holding in his left hand a torch reversed. The\r\n  inscription lets us know,
      that he was Lieutenant-General of his\r\n  Majesty\u2019s armies; that he was
      son to Percy Kirk, Lieutenant-General in\r\n  the reign of King James II. by
      the Lady Mary, daughter to George\r\n  Howard Earl of Suffolk, and that he died
      Jan. 1, 1741, aged\r\n  fifty-seven.\r\n\r\n  68. We come now to the monument
      erected to the memory of that brave\r\n  commander the Lord Aubrey Beauclerk,
      ornamented with arms, trophies,\r\n  and naval ensigns, and in an oval nich
      on a beautiful pyramid of\r\n  dove-coloured marble, is a fine bust of that
      young Hero. On this\r\n  pyramid is the following historical inscription:\r\n\r\n
      \     The Lord Aubrey Beauclerk was the youngest son of Charles Duke\r\n      of
      St. Albans, by Diana, daughter of Aubrey de Vere Earl of\r\n      Oxford. He
      went early to sea, and was made a commander in\r\n      1731. In 1740, he was
      sent upon that memorable expedition to\r\n      Carthagena, under the command
      of Admiral Vernon, in his\r\n      Majesty\u2019s ship the Prince Frederic,
      which, with three others,\r\n      was ordered to cannonade the castle of Boccachica.
      One of\r\n      these being obliged to quit her station, the Prince Frederic\r\n
      \     was exposed, not only to the fire from the castle, but to that\r\n      of
      Fort St. Joseph, and to two ships that guarded the mouth of\r\n      the harbour,
      which he sustained for many hours that day, and\r\n      part of the next, with
      uncommon intrepidity. As he was giving\r\n      his commands upon deck, both
      his legs were shot off; but such\r\n      was his magnanimity, that he would
      not suffer his wounds to be\r\n      drest, till he communicated his orders
      to his first\r\n      Lieutenant, which were, _To fight his ship to the last\r\n
      \     extremity_. Soon after this he gave some directions about his\r\n      private
      affairs, and then resigned his soul with the dignity\r\n      of a Hero and
      a Christian. Thus was he taken off in the\r\n      thirty-first year of his
      age, an illustrious commander of\r\n      superior fortitude and clemency, amiable
      in his person, steady\r\n      in his affections, and equalled by few in the
      social and\r\n      domestic virtues of politeness, modesty, candour, and\r\n
      \     benevolence. He married the widow of Col. Francis Alexander, a\r\n      daughter
      of Sir Henry Newton, Knt. Envoy Extraordinary to the\r\n      Court of Florence
      and the Republic of Genoa, and Judge of the\r\n      high court of Admiralty.\r\n\r\n
      \ Over his inscription is the following epitaph:\r\n\r\n            Whilst Britain
      boasts her Empire o\u2019er the deep,\r\n            This marble shall compel
      the brave to weep;\r\n            As men, as Britons, and as soldiers mourn:\r\n
      \           \u2019Tis dauntless, loyal, virtuous Beauclerk\u2019s urn.\r\n            Sweet
      were his manners, as his soul was great,\r\n            And ripe his worth,
      tho\u2019 immature his fate;\r\n            Each tender grace that joy and love
      inspires,\r\n            Living, he mingled with his martial fires;\r\n            Dying,
      he bid Britannia\u2019s thunder roar,\r\n            And Spain still felt him,
      when he breath\u2019d no more.\r\n\r\n  69. A beautiful monument erected to
      the memory of Admiral Balchen, on\r\n  which is his bust well executed in the
      finest white marble. The\r\n  enrichments, arms and trophies, are admirably
      wrought, but in\r\n  fastening the cable to the anchor this excellent artist
      has shewn that\r\n  he is no mariner. In the front is a fine representation
      of a ship in a\r\n  storm. The inscription is as follows:\r\n\r\n      To the
      memory of Sir John Balchen, Knt. Admiral of the White\r\n      Squadron of his
      Majesty\u2019s fleet in 1744, being sent out\r\n      Commander in chief of
      the combined fleets of England and\r\n      Holland, to cruize on the enemy,
      was on his return home in his\r\n      Majesty\u2019s ship the Victory, lost
      in the Channel by a violent\r\n      storm; from which sad circumstance of his
      death we may learn,\r\n      that neither the greatest skill, judgment, or experience,\r\n
      \     joined to the most firm unshaken resolution, can resist the\r\n      fury
      of the winds and waves; and we are taught from the\r\n      passages of his
      life, which were filled with great and gallant\r\n      actions, but ever accompanied
      with adverse gales of fortune,\r\n      that the brave, the worthy and the good
      man, meets not always\r\n      his reward in this world. Fifty-eight years of
      faithful and\r\n      painful services he had passed, when being just retired
      to the\r\n      government of Greenwich Hospital to wear out the remainder of\r\n
      \     his days, he was once more, and for the last time, called out\r\n      by
      his King and Country, whose interest he ever preferred to\r\n      his own,
      and his unwearied zeal for their service ended only\r\n      in his death; which
      weighty misfortune to his afflicted family\r\n      became heightened by many
      aggravating circumstances attending\r\n      it; yet amidst their grief had
      they the mournful consolation\r\n      to find his gracious and royal Master
      mixing his concern with\r\n      the general lamentations of the public, for
      the calamitous\r\n      fate of so zealous, so valiant, and so able a Commander;
      and\r\n      as a lasting memorial of the sincere love and esteem borne by\r\n
      \     his widow, to a most affectionate and worthy husband, this\r\n      honorary
      monument was erected by her. He was born Feb. 2,\r\n      1669, married Susannah,
      daughter of Col. Apreece of Washingly\r\n      in the County of Huntingdon.
      Died Oct. 7, 1744, leaving one\r\n      son and one daughter, the former of
      whom, George Balchen,\r\n      survived him but a short time; for being sent
      to the West\r\n      Indies in 1745, Commander of his Majesty\u2019s ship the
      Pembroke,\r\n      he died in Barbadoes in December the same year, aged 28,\r\n
      \     having walked in the steps, and imitated the virtue and\r\n      bravery
      of his good, but unfortunate father.\r\n\r\n  70. A noble and elegant monument
      erected in honour of General Guest.\r\n  It is adorned with a pyramid and base
      of the most beautiful Egyptian\r\n  porphyry, ornamented with the finest enrichments,
      and on the latter is\r\n  an admirable bust of the General of white marble.
      The whole is\r\n  executed in the most delicate and masterly manner. It has
      this short,\r\n  but apposite inscription:\r\n\r\n      Sacred to those virtues
      that adorn a Christian and a Soldier,\r\n      this marble perpetuates the memory
      of Lieut. Gen. Joshua\r\n      Guest, who closed a service of sixty years by
      faithfully\r\n      defending Edinburgh castle against the Rebels, 1745.\r\n\r\n
      \ 71. The next worthy of notice is the elegant monument of Sir Charles\r\n  Wager.
      The principal figure here is that of Fame holding a portrait of\r\n  Sir Charles
      in relief, which is also supported by an infant Hercules.\r\n  The enrichments
      are naval trophies, instruments of war and navigation,\r\n  &c. on the base
      is represented in relief the destroying and taking of\r\n  the Spanish galleons
      in 1708, The inscription is as follows:\r\n\r\n                 To the memory
      of Sir CHARLES WAGER, Knt.\r\n        Admiral of the White, first Commissioner
      of the Admiralty,\r\n                          And Privy Counsellor;\r\n                     A
      man of great natural talents,\r\n                      Who bore the highest
      commands,\r\n               And pass\u2019d through the greatest employments,\r\n
      \           With credit to himself, and honour to his country.\r\n                          He
      was in private life\r\n                 Humane, temperate, just, and bountiful:\r\n
      \                           In public station,\r\n                   Valiant,
      prudent, wise, and honest:\r\n                          Easy of access to all;\r\n
      \                  Plain and unaffected in his manners,\r\n                   Steady
      and resolute in his conduct:\r\n               So remarkably happy in his presence
      of mind,\r\n                   That no danger ever discompos\u2019d him;\r\n
      \                   Esteemed and favoured by his King;\r\n                   Beloved
      and honoured by his Country.\r\n                      He died 24 May 1743. Aged
      77.\r\n\r\n  72. The next tomb in the Abbey that demands our attention, is that\r\n
      \ erected to the memory of John Hollis Duke of Newcastle, by his\r\n  daughter
      the Countess of Oxford. This is perhaps the loftiest and most\r\n  costly of
      any in the Abbey. A pediment is supported by beautiful\r\n  columns of variegated
      marble. The Duke is represented resting upon a\r\n  sepulchral monument, holding
      in his right hand a General\u2019s staff, and\r\n  in his left a ducal coronet.
      On one side the base stands a statue of\r\n  Wisdom, on the other, of Sincerity.
      On the angles of the upper\r\n  compartment sit angels, and on the ascending
      sides of the pediment sit\r\n  two cherubs, one with an hour-glass, alluding
      to the admeasurement of\r\n  man\u2019s life by grains of sand; the other pointing
      upwards, where life\r\n  shall no longer be measured by hours and minutes. On
      the base is an\r\n  inscription enumerating his Grace\u2019s titles, and several
      employments;\r\n  his marriage and issue; and informing us that he was born
      Jan. 9,\r\n  1661\u20132, and died July 15, 1711.\r\n\r\n  73. The monument
      of William Cavendish Duke of Newcastle is also very\r\n  pompous, but is in
      the old taste. Under a rich canopy of state lie, as\r\n  the inscription expresses
      it, \u201CThe loyal Duke of Newcastle, and his\r\n  Duchess, his second wife,
      by whom he had no issue: her name was\r\n  Margaret Lucas, youngest sister to
      Lord Lucas of Colchester, a noble\r\n  family; for all the brothers were valiant,
      and all the sisters\r\n  virtuous. The Duchess was a wise, witty, and learned
      Lady, which her\r\n  many books do well testify: She was a most virtuous, and
      a loving and\r\n  careful wife, and was with her Lord all the time of his banishment
      and\r\n  miseries; and when he came home, never parted from him in his solitary\r\n
      \ retirements.\u201D This is the English inscription. The Latin gives his\r\n
      \ titles and employments; and observes, that for his fidelity to King\r\n  Charles
      I. he was made Captain-General of the forces raised for his\r\n  service in
      the North, fought many battles, and generally came off\r\n  victorious; but
      that when the rebels prevailed (being one of the first\r\n  designed a sacrifice)
      he left his estate, and endured a long exile. It\r\n  then gives his issue by
      his first wife, and concludes with observing,\r\n  that he died Dec. 27, 1676,
      in his eighty-fourth year.\r\n\r\n  74. On the adjoining pillar is a neat tablet,
      on which is this\r\n  inscription:\r\n\r\n      Grace, eldest daughter of Sir
      Thomas Mauleverer of Allerton\r\n      Mauleverer in Yorkshire, Bart. born 1622,
      married unto Col.\r\n      Scott, a member of the Hon. House of Commons 1644,
      and died\r\n      Feb. 24, 1645.\r\n\r\n               He that will give my
      GRACE but what is hers,\r\n                 Must say her death has not\r\n                 Made
      only her dear SCOTT,\r\n               But Virtue, Worth, and Sweetness, widowers.\r\n\r\n
      \ 75. The monument of Dame Mary James is neatly ornamented with an urn,\r\n
      \ wreathed and crowned with a Viscount\u2019s coronet, on a handsome pedestal\r\n
      \ The inscription observes that this Lady was wife to Sir John James, of\r\n
      \ the ancient family of the Lords of Hostrick in Holland, and that she\r\n  died
      Nov. 6, 1667.\r\n\r\n  76. A magnificent and elegant monument of white marble
      to the memory\r\n  of Sir Peter Warren, done by Roubiliac. Close to the wall
      is a large\r\n  flag hanging to the flag-staff, and spreading in very natural
      folds\r\n  behind the whole monument. Before it is a fine figure of Hercules\r\n
      \ placing Sir Peter\u2019s bust on its pedestal; and on the other side,\r\n
      \ Victory, with a laurel wreath in her hand, is seated gazing on the\r\n  bust
      with a look of melancholy mixed with admiration. Behind her a\r\n  Cornucopia
      pours out fruit, corn, the fleece, &c. and by it is a\r\n  cannon, an anchor,
      and other decorations. The inscription is as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n                           Sacred
      to the memory\r\n                           Of Sir PETER WARREN,\r\n                           Knight
      of the Bath,\r\n                     Vice-Admiral of the Red Squadron\r\n                          Of
      the British Fleet,\r\n                         And Member of Parliament\r\n
      \                For the City and Liberty of Westminster.\r\n\r\n  And a little
      lower:\r\n\r\n        He derived his descent from an ancient Family of IRELAND,\r\n
      \          His fame and honours from his virtues and abilities.\r\n                   How
      eminently these were displayed,\r\n            With what vigilance and spirit
      they were exerted,\r\n      In the various services wherein he had the honour
      to command,\r\n                      And the happiness to conquer,\r\n             Will
      be more properly recorded in the annals of\r\n                              GREAT
      BRITAIN.\r\n              On this tablet, affection with truth may say,\r\n
      \               That deservedly esteemed in private life,\r\n             And
      universally renowned for his public conduct,\r\n                    The judicious
      and gallant officer\r\n            Possessed all the amiable qualities of the
      Friend,\r\n                    The Gentleman, and the Christian.\r\n                            But
      the ALMIGHTY,\r\n                          Whom alone he feared,\r\n         And
      whose gracious protection he had often experienced,\r\n             Was pleased
      to remove him from a life of honour\r\n                       To an eternity
      of happiness,\r\n        On the 29th day of July 1752, in the 49th year of his
      age.\r\n\r\n  On the bottom of the base:\r\n\r\n            Susannah, his afflicted
      wife, caused this monument\r\n                              to be erected.\r\n\r\n
      \ 77. The monument inscribed to the memory of Sir Gilbert Lort, of\r\n  Stackpole
      in Pembrokeshire, who died Sept. 19, 1698, was erected to\r\n  his memory by
      his sister Dame Elizabeth Campbell of Calder in\r\n  Scotland. The author of
      _The Review of the public buildings_, &c.\r\n  observes, that the two boys here
      placed on each side a little tomb,\r\n  are in a very pretty taste, and a perfect
      contrast to each other; one\r\n  representing passionate, exclamatory grief,
      and the other still and\r\n  silent; and adds, \u201C\u2019Tis pity they are
      divided by so bad an ornament in\r\n  the middle: had they leaned on a single
      urn, which, in the antique\r\n  taste, might have been supposed to hold his
      ashes, they would have had\r\n  a fine effect, and challenged more admiration
      than many a more pompous\r\n  and expensive pile.\u201D\r\n\r\n  78. The monument
      erected to Hugh Chamberlayne, M.D. was some years ago\r\n  esteemed one of the
      best pieces in the Abbey; but some of the later\r\n  monuments greatly exceed
      it. The principal figure lies, as it were, at\r\n  ease, upon a tomb stone,
      leaning upon his right arm, with his hand\r\n  upon his night cap, and his head
      uncovered. In his left hand, he holds\r\n  a book, to shew his intense application
      to study. On each side are the\r\n  emblems of Physic and Longevity; and over
      his head, is Fame descending\r\n  with a trumpet in one hand, and a wreath in
      the other. On the top are\r\n  weeping cherubs, and on the pedestal a long Latin
      inscription, which\r\n  mentions his great knowledge and industry in his profession,
      his\r\n  humanity in relieving the sick, and his affinities and connections
      in\r\n  social and private life. He died June 17, 1728, aged sixty-four.\r\n\r\n
      \ 79. The tomb of Almericus de Courcy, Baron of Kinsale, in Ireland, is\r\n
      \ ornamented with the figure of his Lordship in armour, reposing himself\r\n
      \ after the fatigues of an active life, under a gilded canopy. The\r\n  inscription
      shews, that he was descended from the famous John de\r\n  Courcy, Earl of Ulster,
      who in the reign of King John, in\r\n  consideration of his great valour, obtained
      the extraordinary\r\n  privilege for him and his heirs, of being covered in
      the King\u2019s\r\n  presence. Almericus de Courcy died Feb. 9, 1719, aged fifty-seven.\r\n\r\n
      \ 80. The monument of Sir Thomas Duppa is adorned with flowers and\r\n  foliage,
      and on the top with an urn wreathed. The inscription shews,\r\n  that Sir Thomas
      in his youth waited upon King Charles II. when Prince\r\n  of Wales, and at
      length became Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, in\r\n  which office he died
      April 25, 1694, aged 75.\r\n\r\n  81. We come now to a monument that has been
      much admired, and as much\r\n  censured, that of Dame Elizabeth Carteret, who
      died on the 26th of\r\n  March, 1717, aged fifty-two. This Lady is represented
      springing\r\n  upwards, with only one foot fixed to the earth, and a little
      winged\r\n  seraph descending to receive her; but the disproportions are so
      great\r\n  between them, that one cannot help thinking, that it is much more\r\n
      \ likely she should pull the aerial messenger down, than he raise her\r\n  one
      inch from the ground; but what is still worse, her attitude is\r\n  such, that
      it is impossible she should know that he is coming to give\r\n  her a lift.
      Below her hovering on the base, is another of these\r\n  heavenly spirits unfolding
      a very indifferent epitaph.\r\n\r\n  82. We come now to the grand and magnificent
      monument of the great Sir\r\n  Isaac Newton, whose statue is formed recumbent,
      leaning his right arm\r\n  on four folios, thus titled DIVINITY, CHRONOLOGY,
      OPTICS, and PHIL:\r\n  PRIN: MATH: and pointing to a scroll supported by cherubs.
      Over him is\r\n  a large globe projecting from a pyramid behind, whereon is
      delineated\r\n  the course of the comet in 1680, with the signs, constellations
      and\r\n  planets. On this globe sits the figure of Astronomy, with her book\r\n
      \ closed, in a very thoughtful composed and pensive mood. Beneath the\r\n  principal
      figure is a very fine bas relief, representing the various\r\n  labours in which
      Sir Isaac chiefly employed his time: such as\r\n  discovering the cause of gravitation,
      settling the principles of light\r\n  and colours, and reducing the coinage
      to a determined standard. The\r\n  inscription on the pedestal is in Latin,
      short, but full of meaning,\r\n  intimating, that by a spirit nearly divine,
      he solved on principles of\r\n  his own, the motion and figure of the planets,
      the paths of the\r\n  comets, and the ebbing and flowing of the sea; that he
      discovered the\r\n  dissimularity of the rays of light, and the properties of
      colours from\r\n  thence arising, which none but himself had ever dreamt of;
      that he was\r\n  a diligent, wise and faithful interpreter of nature, antiquity,
      and\r\n  the holy scriptures; that by his philosophy he maintained the dignity\r\n
      \ of the Supreme Being; and by the purity of his life, the simplicity of\r\n
      \ the gospel; and it concludes with a just exclamation, What reason have\r\n
      \ mortals to pride themselves in the existence of so great an ornament\r\n  to
      the human race! He was born Dec. 25, 1642, and died in 1726.\r\n\r\n  So noble
      a monument erected to real merit, is a greater honour to the\r\n  nation than
      to the great genius for whom it was raised; in this light\r\n  it is viewed
      by all Europe.\r\n\r\n  83. On the other side of the entrance into the choir
      is another lofty\r\n  and pompous monument. This last was erected to the memory
      of Earl\r\n  Stanhope, who is also represented leaning upon his arm in a recumbent\r\n
      \ posture, holding in his right hand a General\u2019s staff, and in his left\r\n
      \ a parchment scroll. Before him stands a cupid resting upon a shield.\r\n  Over
      a martial tent sits Minerva, holding in her right hand a javelin,\r\n  and in
      the other a scroll. Behind is a slender pyramid. On the middle\r\n  of the pedestal
      are two medalions, and on each side the pilasters one.\r\n  In short, under
      the principal figure is a Latin inscription,\r\n  displaying the merits of this
      great man, as a soldier, a statesman,\r\n  and a senator: observing, that in
      1707, he concluded an advantageous\r\n  peace with Spain; and the same year
      was sent Embassador to Charles\r\n  III. In 1708, he took Port Mahon: In 1710,
      he forced his way to the\r\n  gates of Madrid, and took possession of that capital:
      In 1715, being\r\n  of the Secret Committee, he impeached the Duke of Ormond.
      In 1717 he\r\n  was made first Commissioner of the treasury, and Chancellor
      of the\r\n  exchequer; and in July following was created a Peer. He died in
      1721,\r\n  in the forty-seventh year of his age.\r\n\r\n  84. Mr. Thynne\u2019s
      monument has always been esteemed a very fine one.\r\n  That gentleman is represented
      dying, and at his feet is a boy weeping.\r\n  Underneath on a table of black
      marble in white letters is this short\r\n  inscription:\r\n\r\n      Thomas
      Thynne of Longleate in Com. Wilts, Esq; who was\r\n      barbarously murdered
      on Sunday the 12th of February, 1682.\r\n\r\n  And upon the pedestal the story
      of his murder is finely represented in\r\n  relief.\r\n\r\n  This last observation
      makes it necessary to give the particulars of\r\n  this murder, which we shall
      do from a very accurate, tho\u2019 small work,\r\n  from which we have obtained
      considerable assistance in the description\r\n  of many things relating to the
      Abbey. The above murder was conspired\r\n  by Count Koningsmark, and executed
      by three assassins hired for that\r\n  purpose, who shot this unhappy gentleman
      in Pall-Mall, in his own\r\n  coach. The motive was, to obtain the rich heiress
      of Northumberland in\r\n  marriage, who in her infancy had been betrothed to
      the Earl of Ogle,\r\n  but left a widow before consummation; and afterwards
      married to Mr.\r\n  Thynne; but being scarce fifteen, and her mother extremely
      tender of\r\n  her, and at the same time desirous of her having issue, prevailed
      upon\r\n  her husband to travel another year before he bedded her, in which
      time\r\n  she became acquainted with Koningsmark at the Court of Hanover.\r\n
      \ Whether she had ever given him any countenance is uncertain; but\r\n  having
      no grounds to hope to obtain her while her husband lived, he in\r\n  this villainous
      manner accomplished his death: the Lady, however,\r\n  detested this base and
      inhuman conduct, and soon after married the\r\n  great Duke of Somerset.\u2014At
      the time this happened, a report was spread\r\n  that Mr. Thynne had formerly
      debauched a woman of family and\r\n  character, on honourable pretences; but
      upon his uncle\u2019s leaving him\r\n  10,000_l._ a year; he basely deserted
      her; whence arose the saying,\r\n  that _he had escaped his misfortune, if he
      had either married the Lady\r\n  he had lain with, or lain with the Lady he
      had married_. But we do not\r\n  pretend to insinuate that there was any truth
      in this story. It may\r\n  probably be only a cruel piece of defamation. _Historical
      Description\r\n  of Westminster Abbey._\r\n\r\n  85. The monument of Dame Grace
      Gethin, is ornamented with a figure of\r\n  a Lady devoutly kneeling, with a
      book in her right hand, and her left\r\n  on her breast; on each side is an
      angel, one holding over her head a\r\n  crown, and the other a chaplet; and
      on the ascending sides of the\r\n  pediment are two female figures in a mournful
      posture. It is adorned\r\n  with three different coats of family arms, and on
      the base is an\r\n  English inscription, which also lets us know that she was
      married to\r\n  Sir Richard Gethin of Gethin Grott in Ireland; was famed for
      her\r\n  exemplary piety, and wrote a book of devotions, which Mr. Congreve
      has\r\n  complimented with a poem. She died Oct. 11, 1697, aged twenty-one.\r\n\r\n
      \ 86. A monument erected to the memory of two sisters, the daughters of\r\n
      \ Ralph Freke of Hannington in Wilts, Esq; whose busts in relief\r\n  ornament
      the sides. The inscription observes, that the eldest, named\r\n  Elizabeth,
      was married to Percey Freke of West Bilney in Norfolk, and\r\n  died on the
      7th of April 1714; that Judith the youngest married Robert\r\n  Austin of Tenterden
      in Kent, and died May 19, 1716: and that they were\r\n  both the best of daughters,
      the best of wives, and the best of\r\n  mothers.\r\n\r\n  87. A large monument
      of black marble erected to the memory of Sir\r\n  Thomas Richardson, Lord Chief
      Justice of England in the reign of King\r\n  Charles I. He died in 1634, and
      his tomb is adorned with his effigy in\r\n  brass, lying in his robes, and his
      collar of S S.\r\n\r\n  88. An ancient monument raised to the memory of William
      Thynne of\r\n  Botterville, Esq.; it is of marble and alabaster gilt, and is
      adorned\r\n  with the statue of that gentleman lying at full length. The\r\n
      \ inscription informs us, that he was a polite gentleman, a great\r\n  traveller,
      and a brave soldier, and that he died on the 14th of March\r\n  1584.\r\n\r\n
      \ 89. A very handsome monument erected for that learned grammarian Dr.\r\n  Busby,
      master of Westminster school; who is represented in his gown,\r\n  looking earnestly
      at the inscription; holding in his right hand a pen,\r\n  and in his left a
      book open. Upon the pedestal underneath are a\r\n  variety of books, and at
      the top is his family arms. The inscription\r\n  is a very elegant one, and
      intimates whatsoever fame the school of\r\n  Westminster boasts, and whatever
      advantages mankind shall reap from\r\n  thence in future times, are all principally
      owing to the wise\r\n  institutions of this gentleman, who was born at Lutton
      in\r\n  Lincolnshire, Sept. 22, 1606, and after being made Master of\r\n  Westminster
      college was elected Prebendary of Westminster, and\r\n  Treasurer of Wells.
      He died April 5, 1695.\r\n\r\n  90. The next monument, is that erected to the
      memory of Robert South,\r\n  D.D. who is represented in a recumbent posture
      in his canonical habit,\r\n  with his arm resting on a cushion, and his right
      hand on a death\u2019s\r\n  head. In his left he holds a book with his finger
      between the leaves,\r\n  as if just closed from reading, and over his head is
      a group of\r\n  cherubs issuing from a mantling. This monument is however very
      badly\r\n  executed, and the statue is clumsy and unmeaning. It has a long Latin\r\n
      \ inscription, shewing that this celebrated divine was scholar to Dr.\r\n  Busby,
      and student at Christ Church, Oxford; that by the patronage of\r\n  the Lord
      Clarendon he was made Prebendary both of Westminster and\r\n  Christ Church,
      and afterwards rector of Islip, where he rebuilt the\r\n  parsonage house, and
      founded and endowed a school for the education of\r\n  poor children. He died
      on the 8th of July 1718, aged eighty-two.\r\n\r\n  _The Monuments in the Cloisters._
      The most ancient of these are\r\n  towards the east end of the south walk, where
      lie the remains of four\r\n  Abbots marked in the pavement by four stones.\r\n\r\n
      \ The first of these covers the Abbot Vitales, who died in 1082, and was\r\n
      \ formerly covered with brass plates.\r\n\r\n  The second is of grey marble,
      to the memory of Gislebertus Crispinus,\r\n  who died in 1114, and whose effigies
      may still be traced on the stone.\r\n\r\n  Under the third, which is a raised
      stone of Sussex marble, lies the\r\n  Abbot Laurentius, who died in 1176, and
      is said to be the first who\r\n  obtained from Pope Alexander III. the privilege
      of using the mitre,\r\n  ring and globe.\r\n\r\n  The last is of black marble,
      and covers the ashes of Gervasius de\r\n  Blois, who was natural son to King
      Stephen, and died in 1166. This is\r\n  called Long Meg, from its extraordinary
      length, it being eleven feet\r\n  eight inches. All these seem to have had their
      names and dates cut\r\n  afresh.\r\n\r\n  In the east walk is a handsome monument
      erected to the memory of\r\n  Daniel Pulteney, Esq; facing those of the above
      Abbots; the\r\n  inscription on which is much admired for the purity of the
      diction,\r\n  and its propriety and elegance, and is as follows:\r\n\r\n                                 Reader,\r\n
      \                         If thou art a BRITON,\r\n               Behold this
      tomb with reverence and regret.\r\n                        Here lieth the remains
      of\r\n                             DANIEL PULTENEY,\r\n                 The
      kindest relation, the truest friend,\r\n                 The warmest patriot,
      the worthiest man;\r\n                    He exercised virtues in this age,\r\n
      \         Sufficient to have distinguished him even in the best.\r\n                           Sagacious
      by nature,\r\n                          Industrious by habit,\r\n                          Inquisitive
      with art,\r\n         He gain\u2019d a compleat knowledge of the state of Britain,\r\n
      \                         Foreign and domestic.\r\n            In most the backward
      fruit of tedious experience,\r\n           In him the early acquisition of undissipated
      youth.\r\n                    He served the court several years:\r\n              Abroad
      in the auspicious reign of Queen Anne,\r\n   At home, in the reign of that excellent
      Prince K. George the First.\r\n                      He served his country always,\r\n
      \                         At court independent,\r\n                         In
      the senate unbiass\u2019d,\r\n                   At every age, and in every
      station:\r\n                 This was the bent of his generous soul,\r\n               This
      was the business of his laborious life.\r\n                      Public men,
      and public things,\r\n                   He judged by one constant standard,\r\n
      \                    _The true interest of Britain_;\r\n                  He
      made no other distinction of party,\r\n                          He abhorred
      all other:\r\n                Gentle, humane, disinterested, beneficent,\r\n
      \               He created no enemies on his own account:\r\n                      Firm,
      determined, inflexible,\r\n         He feared none he could create in the cause
      of Britain.\r\n                                 Reader,\r\n            In this
      misfortune of thy country, lament thy own:\r\n                                 For
      know\r\n                    The loss of so much private virtue\r\n                          Is
      a public calamity.\r\n\r\n  Almost at the end of the north east walk is a monument
      against the\r\n  Abbey wall to the memory of the Rev. Mr. William Laurence,
      the\r\n  inscription on which is remarkable for its quaintness, and is as\r\n
      \ follows:\r\n\r\n            With diligence and trust exemplary,\r\n            Did
      William Laurence serve a Prebendary;\r\n            And for his pains, now past,
      before not lost,\r\n            Gain\u2019d this remembrance at his master\u2019s
      cost.\r\n                O! read these lines again, you seldom find\r\n                A
      servant faithful, and his master kind.\r\n            Short-hand he wrote, his
      flower in prime did fade,\r\n            And hasty death short hand of him hath
      made.\r\n            Well couth he numbers, and well measur\u2019d land,\r\n
      \           Thus doth he now that ground whereon we stand,\r\n            Whereon
      he lies so geometrical,\r\n            Art maketh some, but thus will Nature
      all.\r\n                                  Ob. Dec. 28. 1621. \xC6tat. 29.\r\n\r\n\r\n
      \ [Illustration: _S. Wale delin._ _E. Rooker sc._ _Henry the Seventh\u2019s\r\n
      \ Chapel._]\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Henry the Seventh\u2019s Chapel._ As this is a separate
      building from\r\n  Westminster Abbey, we did not think proper to confound it
      with the\r\n  other chapels; and as it is joined to the Abbey, we did not chuse
      to\r\n  render it so distinct an article as it would have been, had we given\r\n
      \ it the place it would have demanded in the order of the alphabet. It\r\n  is
      to be examined at the same time with that edifice, and we have\r\n  followed
      the example of the architect in uniting them.\r\n\r\n  This chapel, which was
      founded by Henry VII. in the year 1502, and the\r\n  succeeding years, is styled
      by Leland the wonder of the world. It is\r\n  situated to the east of the Abbey,
      to which it is so neatly joined,\r\n  that on a superficial view it appears
      to be one and the same building.\r\n  It is supported by fourteen Gothic buttresses,
      all beautifully\r\n  ornamented, and projecting from the building in different
      angles, and\r\n  is enlightened by a double range of windows that throw the
      light into\r\n  such a happy disposition as at once to please the eye, and afford
      a\r\n  kind of solemn gloom. These buttresses extend up to the roof, and are\r\n
      \ made to strengthen it by their being crowned with Gothic arches. In\r\n  these
      buttresses are niches, in which formerly stood a number of\r\n  statues; but
      these being greatly decayed, have been long taken down.\r\n\r\n  This chapel
      is one of the most expensive remains of the ancient\r\n  English taste and magnificence;
      there is no looking upon it without\r\n  admiration: yet, perhaps, its beauty
      consists much more eminently in\r\n  the workmanship than the contrivance. The
      plate shews the outside,\r\n  where it joins to the Abbey, and gives some idea
      of the fine taste of\r\n  Gothic architecture in that age, which seems to have
      been its\r\n  meridian; but it soon fell into the bad taste practised in the
      time of\r\n  Queen Elizabeth, as may be seen in the tomb of this Queen and her\r\n
      \ predecessor in the side aisles of this chapel.\r\n\r\n  This may be sufficient
      for the outside of this edifice, the entrance\r\n  to which is from the east
      end of the Abbey, by a flight of steps of\r\n  black marble, under a very noble
      arch, that leads to the gates opening\r\n  to the body or nave of the chapel:
      for, like a cathedral it is divided\r\n  into a nave and side isles, to which
      you may enter by a door on each\r\n  hand. The gates at the entrance of the
      nave are of brass curiously\r\n  wrought in the manner of frame work, and have
      in every other open\r\n  pannel a rose and portcullis alternately.\r\n\r\n  Being
      entered, the eye is naturally directed to the lofty ceiling, in\r\n  the most
      admirable manner wrought with such an astonishing variety of\r\n  figures as
      is impossible to be described. The stalls on each side are\r\n  of oak, with
      Gothic canopies, most beautifully carved, as are also the\r\n  seats; and the
      pavement is of black and white marble, laid at the\r\n  charge of Dr. Killigrew,
      once Prebendary of this Abbey. The east view\r\n  from the entrance presents
      you with the brass chapel and tomb of the\r\n  founder, which will be hereafter
      described, and round it where the\r\n  east end forms a semicircle, are the
      chapels of the Dukes of\r\n  Buckingham and Richmond. At that end the side isles
      open to the nave.\r\n  It must not be omitted, that the walls both of the nave
      and the side\r\n  isles are adorned with the most curious imagery imaginable,
      and\r\n  contain an hundred and twenty statues of patriarchs, saints, martyrs\r\n
      \ and confessors, under which are angels supporting imperial crowns,\r\n  besides
      innumerable small ones, all of them esteemed so curious, that\r\n  the best
      masters are said to have travelled from abroad to copy them.\r\n  The roof of
      the side isles is flattish, and supported on arches\r\n  between the nave and
      side isles turning upon twelve stately Gothic\r\n  pillars, curiously adorned
      with figures, fruitage and foliage. The\r\n  windows, besides a spacious one
      at the east end, are thirteen on each\r\n  side above and as many below, and
      were formerly painted, having in\r\n  each pane a white rose, the badge of the
      house of Lancaster, a B the\r\n  initial letter of the founder\u2019s name,
      or portcullises crowned, the\r\n  badge of the Beaufort\u2019s family, of which
      there are some now remaining.\r\n\r\n  This chapel was originally designed as
      a sepulchre appropriated solely\r\n  to the use of those of royal blood; and
      so far has the will of the\r\n  founder been observed, that none have been yet
      interred there, but\r\n  those of high quality, whose descent may generally
      be traced from some\r\n  of our ancient Kings: I shall therefore mention each
      of these tombs,\r\n  beginning with that which is the most ancient, as well
      as the most\r\n  astonishing.\r\n\r\n  It has been already observed, that in
      the middle of the east end of\r\n  the nave is situated the magnificent tomb
      of Henry VII. this is\r\n  enclosed with a screen of cast brass, most admirably
      designed, and\r\n  executed; this screen is nineteen feet in length, eleven
      in breadth,\r\n  and the same in height. It is ornamented with statues, of which
      those\r\n  only of St. James, St. Bartholomew, St. George, and St. Edward, are\r\n
      \ now remaining; and also adorned with other devices alluding to King\r\n  Henry
      the Seventh\u2019s family; as portcullises, signifying his relation\r\n  to
      the Beaufort\u2019s by his mother\u2019s side; roses twisted and crowned, in\r\n
      \ memory of the union of the two houses of Lancaster and York, by his\r\n  marriage;
      and at each end a crown in a bush, alluding to the crown of\r\n  Richard III.
      found in a hawthorn bush, near Bosworth field, where the\r\n  famous battle
      was fought in which Richard lost his life. Within the\r\n  rails are the effigies
      of the royal pair, in their robes of state, on\r\n  a tomb of black marble,
      the head whereof is supported by a red dragon\r\n  the ensign of Cadwalladar,
      from whom King Henry VII. was fond of\r\n  tracing his descent, and the foot
      by an angel.\r\n\r\n  At the head of this tomb lie the remains of Edward VI.
      grandson to\r\n  Henry VII. who died in the sixteenth year of his age, and the
      seventh\r\n  of his reign. A fine monument was erected to his memory by Queen
      Mary,\r\n  his sister and successor; it was adorned with curious sculpture\r\n
      \ representing the passion and resurrection of our Saviour; with two\r\n  angels
      on the top kneeling; and the whole elegantly finished; but it\r\n  was afterwards
      demolished as a relict of Popish superstition.\r\n\r\n  On one side of Henry
      the Seventh\u2019s tomb in a small chapel, in which is\r\n  the monument of
      Lewis Stuart Duke of Richmond, and Frances his wife;\r\n  whose statues in cast
      brass are represented lying on a marble table\r\n  under a canopy of brass curiously
      wrought, and supported by the\r\n  figures of Faith, Hope, Charity, and Prudence;
      and on the top is a\r\n  figure of Fame taking her flight, and resting only
      on her toe.\r\n\r\n  On the north side of Henry the Seventh\u2019s tomb is a
      monument decorated\r\n  with several emblematical figures in brass gilt; the
      principal is\r\n  Neptune in a pensive posture with his trident reversed, and
      Mars with\r\n  his head crushed; these support the tomb on which lie the effigies
      of\r\n  George Villars Duke of Buckingham, the great favourite of King James\r\n
      \ I. and King Charles I. who fell a sacrifice to the national resentment\r\n
      \ by the hand of Felton. His Grace married Catharine, daughter to the\r\n  Earl
      of Rutland, who erected this monument to his memory, and lies in\r\n  effigy
      on the same tomb by his side. The Latin inscription, after\r\n  recounting his
      noble qualities, and high titles, alludes to the story\r\n  of his death.\r\n\r\n
      \ Of a later date, and superior in point of design and workmanship, is a\r\n
      \ noble monument erected to the memory of John Sheffield Duke of\r\n  Buckingham,
      where his Grace\u2019s statue in a Roman habit, is laid in a\r\n  half raised
      posture on an altar of fine marble: his Duchess is\r\n  represented standing
      at his feet weeping. On each side are military\r\n  trophies; and over all an
      admirable figure of Time holding several\r\n  medallions representing the heads
      of their Graces children. This\r\n  monument is very justly admired. It has
      been observed, that the Duke\r\n  himself appears the principal figure in the
      group, and though he lies\r\n  in a recumbent posture, and his Lady is in the
      most beautiful manner\r\n  placed at his feet, yet her figure is so characterized,
      as to be only\r\n  a guide to his, and both reflect back a beauty on each other.
      The\r\n  decorations are allowed to be extremely picturesque and elegant; the\r\n
      \ trophies at his head, the figure of Time above, with the medallions of\r\n
      \ his children, fill up all the spaces with such propriety, that little\r\n
      \ could be added, and nothing appears superfluous. The inscription sets\r\n
      \ forth the Duke of Buckingham\u2019s posts, and his qualifications as a good\r\n
      \ poet, and a fine writer; and over his statue is inscribed in Latin\r\n  sentences
      to the following purpose:\r\n\r\n             I lived doubtful, not dissolute.\r\n
      \            I die unresolved, not unresigned.\r\n             Ignorance and
      error are incident to human nature.\r\n             I trust in an Almighty and
      All-good God.\r\n             Thou King of Kings have mercy upon me.\r\n\r\n
      \ And underneath:\r\n\r\n                For my King often, for my Country always.\r\n\r\n
      \     His Grace died in the 57th year of his age, Feb. 24, 1720,\r\n      leaving
      the publication of his works to the care of Mr. Pope.\r\n      He had three
      wives; the first, Ursula, Countess of Coventry;\r\n      the second, Catharine,
      Countess of Gainsborough; the third,\r\n      Catharine, Countess of Anglesey.\r\n\r\n
      \ In this isle there is a lofty pyramid supported by two griffins of\r\n  gilt
      brass, on a pedestal of the most curious marble, erected to the\r\n  memory
      of Charles Montague, Marquis of Halifax, son to George Montague\r\n  of Horton.
      He was placed at the head of the treasury in the reign of\r\n  King Charles
      I. and undertaking the reformation of the coin, which was\r\n  then most infamously
      clipped, he restored it to its proper value. For\r\n  this, and other public
      services, he was first created Baron, and then\r\n  Marquis of Halifax.\r\n\r\n
      \ Against the east wall at the end of the north isle is a monument in\r\n  the
      form of a beautiful altar, raised by King Charles II. to the\r\n  memory of
      Edward V. and his brother Richard, on which is an\r\n  inscription in Latin,
      to the following purport:\r\n\r\n      Here lie the reliques of Edward V. King
      of England, and\r\n      Richard Duke of York, who, being confined in the Tower,
      and\r\n      there stifled with pillows, were privately and meanly buried,\r\n
      \     by order of their perfidious uncle Richard the Usurper. Their\r\n      bones,
      long enquired after and wished for, after lying two\r\n      hundred and one
      years in the rubbish of the stairs, lately\r\n      leading to the chapel of
      the White Tower, were on the 17th of\r\n      July 1674, by undoubted proofs
      discovered; being buried deep\r\n      in that place. Charles II. pitying their
      unhappy fate, ordered\r\n      these unfortunate Princes to be laid amongst
      the reliques of\r\n      their predecessors, in the year 1678, and the 20th
      of his\r\n      reign.\r\n\r\n  At the east end of the same isle is a vault
      in which are deposited the\r\n  bodies of King James I. and Anne his Queen,
      daughter to Frederic II.\r\n  King of Denmark.\r\n\r\n  Over this vault is a
      small tomb adorned with the figure of a child,\r\n  erected to the memory of
      Mary the third daughter of James I. who was\r\n  born at Greenwich in 1605,
      and died at two years old.\r\n\r\n  There is also another monument on which
      is the representation of a\r\n  child in a cradle, erected to the memory of
      Sophia, the fourth\r\n  daughter of the same King, who was born at Greenwich
      in 1606, and died\r\n  three days after.\r\n\r\n  In the same isle is a lofty
      monument erected to the memory of Queen\r\n  Elizabeth by King James I. her
      successor. The inscription represents\r\n  her character, high descent, and
      the memorable acts of her glorious\r\n  reign, \u201CThat she was the mother
      of her country, and the patroness of\r\n  religion and learning; was herself
      skilled in many languages, adorned\r\n  with every excellence of mind and person,
      and endowed with princely\r\n  virtues beyond her sex: that in her reign religion
      was refined to its\r\n  original purity; peace was established; money restored
      to its just\r\n  value; domestic insurrections quelled; France delivered from
      intestine\r\n  troubles; the Netherlands supported; the Spanish Armada defeated;\r\n
      \ Ireland, almost lost by the secret contrivances of Spain, recovered;\r\n  the
      revenues of both universities improved by a law of provisions;\r\n  and, in
      short, all England enriched. That she was a most prudent\r\n  Governess, forty-five
      years a virtuous and triumphant Queen; truly\r\n  religious, and blest in all
      her great affairs; and that after a calm\r\n  and resigned death in the 70th
      year of her age, she left her mortal\r\n  part to be deposited in this church,
      which she established upon a new\r\n  footing, till by the word of Christ she
      is called to immortality.\u201D She\r\n  died March 24, 1602.\r\n\r\n  In the
      south isle is a lofty and pompous tomb erected to the memory of\r\n  Mary Queen
      of Scots, the mother of King James I. who flying into\r\n  England from her
      rebellious subjects, was taken prisoner, tried and\r\n  condemned for conspiring
      the death of Queen Elizabeth, and on the 8th\r\n  of February 1587, beheaded
      on a scaffold erected in the hall of\r\n  Fotheringhay Castle, in Northamptonshire.
      She was afterwards pompously\r\n  interred by order of Queen Elizabeth, in the
      cathedral church of\r\n  Peterborough; but upon the accession of her son to
      the throne of\r\n  England, he ordered her remains to be removed from thence,
      and placed\r\n  near this monument.\r\n\r\n  Near the last monument is a tomb
      enclosed with iron rails, on which\r\n  lies a Lady also finely robed, the effigies
      of Margaret Douglas,\r\n  daughter of Margaret Queen of Scots by the Earl of
      Angus. Her son the\r\n  Lord Darnely, father to King James I. is represented
      foremost on the\r\n  tomb kneeling, with the crown over his head, and there
      are seven other\r\n  of her children represented round the tomb. This great
      Lady, though\r\n  she herself never sat on the throne, had, according to the
      English\r\n  inscription, King Edward IV. to her great grandfather; Henry VII.
      to\r\n  her grandfather; Henry VIII. to her uncle; Edward VI. to her cousin\r\n
      \ german; James V. of Scotland to her brother; Henry I. of Scotland to\r\n  her
      son; James VI. to her brother. Having to her great grandmother and\r\n  grandmother
      two Queens, both named Elizabeth; to her mother, Margaret\r\n  Queen of Scots;
      to her aunt, Mary the French Queen; to her cousins\r\n  german, Mary and Elizabeth
      Queens of England; and to her niece and\r\n  daughter-in-law, Mary Queen of
      Scots. This great Lady died March 10,\r\n  1577.\r\n\r\n  In the south side
      is likewise the monument of Margaret Countess of\r\n  Richmond, mother to Henry
      VII. by her first husband Henry Tudor. She\r\n  was afterwards married to Humphry
      Stafford, a younger son to Humphry\r\n  Duke of Buckingham, and at last to Thomas
      Lord Stanley, Earl of Derby;\r\n  but by the two last had no children. The inscription
      mentions the\r\n  charities of this humane and generous Princess, particularly
      her\r\n  founding two colleges at Oxford, Christ Church and St. John\u2019s;
      and a\r\n  grammar school at Winbourne. She died in July 1509, in the reign
      of\r\n  her grandson Henry VIII.\r\n\r\n  At the east end of this isle is the
      royal vault of King Charles II.,\r\n  King William III., Queen Mary his Consort,
      Queen Anne, and Prince\r\n  George.\r\n\r\n  Over these royal Personages are
      their effigies (except that of Prince\r\n  George) in wainscot presses; they
      are of wax work resembling life, and\r\n  dressed in their coronation robes.\r\n\r\n
      \ Another wainscot press is placed at the corner of the great east\r\n  window,
      in which is the effigy of the Lady Mary Duchess of Richmond,\r\n  daughter to
      James Duke of Richmond and Lenox, dressed in the very\r\n  robes her Grace wore
      at the coronation of Queen Anne.\r\n\r\n  On leaving this isle you will be shewn
      in another wainscot press the\r\n  effigies of General Monk, who had a great
      share in the restoration of\r\n  King Charles II. to the throne of England,
      and was interred in a vault\r\n  appropriated to him and his family. He is represented
      in armour, and\r\n  his ducal cap is generally made use of by those who shew
      this chapel,\r\n  to receive the bounty of those who visit it; these persons
      having no\r\n  share of the money paid for seeing it.\r\n\r\n  Thus have we
      given a description of every thing remarkable in the\r\n  Abbey, and that venerable
      pile adjoining to it, called Henry the\r\n  Seventh\u2019s chapel; we have mentioned
      and described the monuments in\r\n  both that are worthy of notice, and we shall
      conclude this article\r\n  with the following reflections, extracted from an
      ingenious writer, on\r\n  this subject.\r\n\r\n      \u201CHowever amiable fame
      may be to the living, \u2019tis certain no\r\n      advantage to the dead, whatever
      dangers they have dared,\r\n      whatever toils they have undergone, whatever
      difficulties they\r\n      have surmounted; the grave is deaf to the voice of
      applause,\r\n      and the dust of the noble and vulgar sleep in the same\r\n
      \     obscurity together. \u2019Tis possible the conscious spirit may\r\n      have
      an idea of the honour that is paid to his ashes; but \u2019tis\r\n      much
      more probable, that the prospect of this imaginary glory,\r\n      while he
      lived among us, was all the pleasure it ever could\r\n      afford him. I make
      this observation, because most monuments\r\n      are said to be erected as
      an honour to the dead, and the\r\n      living are supposed to be the least
      concerned in them: but one\r\n      man\u2019s fame is made the foundation of
      another\u2019s, in the same\r\n      manner with the gentleman\u2019s, who ordered
      this sentence to be\r\n      made his epitaph; HERE LIES SIR PHILIP SIDNEY\u2019S
      FRIEND. Some\r\n      there are that mention only the names of the persons whose\r\n
      \     dust they cover, and preserve a noble silence with regard to\r\n      the
      hand that raised them; but even here, the dead can receive\r\n      no benefit
      from such disinterested affection; but the living\r\n      may profit much by
      so noble an example. Another thing that\r\n      displeases me is the manner
      of the inscriptions, which\r\n      frequently mistake the very design of engraving
      them, and as\r\n      frequently give the lie to themselves. To pore one\u2019s
      self\r\n      blind in guessing out _\xC6tern\xE6 Memori\xE6 Sacrum_, is a jest,
      that\r\n      would make Heraclitus laugh; and yet most of them begin in\r\n
      \     that pompous taste, without the least reflection that brass\r\n      and
      marble can\u2019t preserve them from the tooth of Time; and if\r\n      men\u2019s
      actions have not guarded their reputations, the proudest\r\n      monument would
      flatter in vain. Sepulchral monuments should be\r\n      always considered as
      the last public tribute paid to virtue;\r\n      as a proof of our regard for
      noble characters, and most\r\n      particularly as an excitement to others
      to emulate the great\r\n      example.\r\n\r\n      \u201CIt is certain there
      is not a nobler amusement, than a walk\r\n      in Westminster Abbey, among
      the tombs of heroes, patriots,\r\n      poets, and philosophers; you are surrounded
      with the shades\r\n      of your great forefathers; you feel the influence of
      their\r\n      venerable society, and grow fond of fame and virtue in the\r\n
      \     contemplation: \u2019tis the finest school of morality, and the\r\n      most
      beautiful flatterer of imagination in nature. I appeal\r\n      to any man\u2019s
      mind that has any taste for what is sublime and\r\n      noble, for a witness
      to the pleasure he experiences on this\r\n      occasion; and I dare believe
      he will acknowledge, that there\r\n      is no entertainment so various, or
      so instructive. For my\r\n      own part, I have spent many an hour of pleasing
      melancholy\r\n      in its venerable walks; and have been more delighted with\r\n
      \     the solemn conversation of the dead, than the most sprightly\r\n      sallies
      of the living. I have examined the characters that\r\n      were inscribed before
      me, and distinguished every particular\r\n      virtue. The monuments of real
      fame, I have viewed with real\r\n      respect; but the piles that wanted a
      character to excuse\r\n      them, I considered as the monuments of folly. I
      have\r\n      wandered with pleasure into the most gloomy recesses of this\r\n
      \     last resort of grandeur, to contemplate human life, and\r\n      trace
      mankind thro\u2019 all the wilderness of their frailties\r\n      and misfortunes,
      from their cradles to their grave. I have\r\n      reflected on the shortness
      of our duration here, and that I\r\n      was but one of the millions who had
      been employed in the\r\n      same manner, in ruminating on the trophies of
      mortality\r\n      before me; that I must moulder to dust in the same manner,\r\n
      \     and quit the scene to a new generation, without leaving the\r\n      shadow
      of my existence behind me; that this huge fabric,\r\n      this sacred repository
      of fame and grandeur, would only be\r\n      the stage for the same performances;
      would receive new\r\n      accessions of noble dust; would be adorned with other\r\n
      \     sepulchres of cost and magnificence; would be crouded with\r\n      successive
      admirers; and at last, by the unavoidable decays\r\n      of time, bury the
      whole collection of antiquities in general\r\n      obscurity, and be the monument
      of its own ruin.\u201D\r\n\r\nABBOTS LANGLEY, a village in Hertfordshire, situated
      to the east of\r\n  Kings Langley, and three or four miles to the S. W. of St.
      Alban\u2019s, to\r\n  whose abbey it once belonged. It is famous for being the
      birth place\r\n  of Nicholas Breakspeare, who was made Pope by the title of
      Adrian IV.\r\n  and had his stirrup held by the Emperor Frederic while he dismounted:\r\n
      \ but notwithstanding his pride, it is a still more indelible stain to\r\n  his
      memory, that when Sovereign Pontiff, he suffer\u2019d his mother to be\r\n  maintained

      is held in Doctors Commons, was\r\n  formerly under the direction of the Lord
      High Admiral, as it is now\r\n  under the Lords of the Admiralty, who here take
      cognisance of all\r\n  causes relating to merchants and mariners. The proceedings
      are in the\r\n  Civil Law. The plaintiff gives security to prosecute, and if
      cast, to\r\n  pay what shall be adjudged, and likewise to stand to all his proctor\r\n
      \ shall transact in his name. But in criminal cases, as the trial of\r\n  pirates,
      and crimes committed at sea, the process, by a special\r\n  commission, is by
      a judge, jury and witnesses, a Judge of the Common\r\n  Law assisting: on which
      occasion the court is commonly held at the\r\n  Session-house in the Old Bailey.
      The officers of this court are the\r\n  Judge of the Admiralty, who must be
      a Civilian, an Advocate and\r\n  Proctor, a Register, and a Marshal, who carries
      a silver oar before\r\n  the Judge.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _S. Wale delin._

      English first sent ships to Africa on account of\r\n  commerce about the year
      1553, from which time the trade to that\r\n  country was carried on by private
      hands till 1588, when Queen\r\n  Elizabeth, by her letters patent, erected a
      company, for the more\r\n  effectual promoting of that trade, which then was
      only for gold,\r\n  elephants teeth, and Guinea pepper; for the use of negroes
      was not yet\r\n  introduced into America.\r\n\r\n  This company was greatly
      encouraged during the reigns of James I. and\r\n  Charles I. but the Dutch taking
      several forts on the coast of Africa\r\n  from the Portuguese, committed great
      depredations on the English, upon\r\n  which Charles II. the better to enable
      his subjects to carry on that\r\n  trade, incorporated a body of merchants,
      in the year 1662, by the\r\n  title of _The Company of Royal Adventurers of
      England to Africa_: but\r\n  the subscriptions for carrying on this precarious
      commerce not\r\n  answering the expectation of the incorporated merchants, they
      were\r\n  soon involved in debt, and reduced to such difficulties as rendered\r\n
      \ them unable to continue their trade to advantage; wherefore they\r\n  agreed
      for a certain sum, to surrender their charter to the crown, and\r\n  to assign
      all their estates and effects both at home and abroad to\r\n  certain merchants,
      who intended to erect a new company, for the more\r\n  effectual carrying on
      a trade to Africa: these merchants the King\r\n  incorporated in the year 1672,
      and these were the Royal African\r\n  company, who had a power to trade from
      the port of Sallee, to the Cape\r\n  of Good Hope, exclusive of all the King\u2019s
      other subjects, during the\r\n  term of a thousand years.\r\n\r\n  By virtue
      of this royal grant, the company made a considerable\r\n  progress in erecting
      forts, and settling factors: but their trade\r\n  being laid open by parliament
      in the year 1697, they were rendered\r\n  unable to support their forts, it
      was therefore enacted, that all\r\n  private traders to Africa should pay ten
      _per cent._ to the company\r\n  for that purpose.\r\n\r\n  This duty did not
      however answer the end for which it was granted, and\r\n  the company was obliged
      to apply to parliament in the year 1730 for\r\n  relief, when they obtained
      a certain sum for that purpose, and it was\r\n  enacted that all his Majesty\u2019s
      subjects treading to and from Africa,\r\n  between Cape Blanco and the Cape
      of Good Hope, should hereafter be\r\n  deemed a body corporate, and that all
      the countries, islands, rivers\r\n  and places, together with the forts, should
      be in the possession of\r\n  this new company; the members of which should not
      trade to or from\r\n  Africa in their joint capacity, have any joint or transferable
      stock,\r\n  or borrow money on their common seal. That the persons trading or\r\n
      \ intending to trade to Africa, should pay to the Chamberlain of London,\r\n
      \ the Clerk of the Merchants-hall in Bristol, or the Town Clerk of\r\n  Liverpool,
      40_s._ each for the freedom of the new company. That the\r\n  management of
      the affairs of this new company, should be under the\r\n  direction of a committee
      of nine persons, to be chosen annually, three\r\n  out of the members in the
      city of London, three out of those of\r\n  Bristol, and three out of those of
      Liverpool. That this committee\r\n  should have power to make orders for the
      government and improvement of\r\n  the forts and factories; to appoint governors,
      and other officers\r\n  civil and military; to receive annually the sum of 40_s._
      and to take\r\n  a list of the names of all the persons making payment.\r\n\r\n
      \ It is also enacted, that the committee shall once a year give an\r\n  account
      of all their transactions to the Commissioners for trade and\r\n  plantations,
      and likewise lay before the Cursitor Baron of the\r\n  Exchequer, an account,
      upon oath, of all the money they have received\r\n  within the preceding year,
      and the application thereof; and the Lords\r\n  of the Admiralty are to give
      instructions to the Captains of such of\r\n  his Majesty\u2019s ships of war
      as shall be stationed or ordered to cruize\r\n  within the above limits, to
      inspect, and make report to them from time\r\n  to time of the state of the
      forts and settlements, copies of which are\r\n  to be laid before the parliament

      ALBAN\u2019S, a large and very ancient town in Hertfordshire, 21 miles\r\n  from
      London, was so called from St. Alban, who suffered in the\r\n  persecution under
      Dioclesian, and being afterwards canonized, and\r\n  interred on a hill in the
      neighbourhood of this town, a monastery was\r\n  erected and dedicated to him
      by King Offa. King Edward I. erected a\r\n  magnificent cross in memory of Queen
      Eleanor; and King Edward VI.\r\n  incorporated this town by a charter, granting
      the inhabitants a Mayor,\r\n  a Steward, a Chamberlain, and ten Burgesses: but
      the Mayor and Steward\r\n  are here the only Justices of peace. Here are three
      churches, besides\r\n  the ancient cathedral called St. Alban\u2019s, belonging
      to the monastery,\r\n  which is now a parish church.\r\n\r\n  In this ancient
      edifice is a funeral monument and effigies of King\r\n  Offa, its founder, who
      is represented seated on his throne; and\r\n  underneath is the following inscription:\r\n\r\n

      OFFA _known._\r\n\r\n  On the east side stood the shrine of St. Alban, where
      the following\r\n  short inscription is still to be seen;\r\n\r\n      S. ALBANUS
      VEROLAMENSIS, ANGLORUM PROTOMARTYR, 17 Junii 293.\r\n\r\n  In the south isle
      near the above shrine is the monument of Humphry,\r\n  brother to King Henry
      V. commonly distinguished by the title of the\r\n  Good Duke of Gloucester.
      It is adorned with a ducal coronet, and the\r\n  arms of France and England
      quartered. In niches on one side are\r\n  seventeen Kings; but in the niches
      on the other side there are no\r\n  statues remaining. The inscription, which
      alludes to the pretended\r\n  miraculous cure of a blind man detected by the
      Duke, is as follows:\r\n\r\n                      Pi\xE6 Memori\xE6 V. Opt.

      bones this spot of land:\r\n            Yet spite of envy shall his glory stand.\r\n\r\n
      \ About 40 years ago in digging a grave, a pair of stairs were\r\n  discovered
      that lead down into a vault where his leaden coffin was\r\n  found, in which
      his body was preserved entire, by a kind of pickle in\r\n  which it lay, only
      the flesh was wasted from the legs, the pickle at\r\n  that end being dried
      up. Many curious medals and coins are to be seen\r\n  in the church, that have
      been dug out of the ruins of Old Verulam that\r\n  stood on the other side of
      the river Ver, or Moore, which runs south\r\n  west of the town.\r\n\r\n  Near
      St. Alban\u2019s is a fort, at a place called by the common people the\r\n  Oyster
      Hills, which is supposed to have been the camp of Ostorius, the\r\n  Roman Propr\xE6tor.
      This town is the largest in the county, and besides\r\n  the four churches,
      has several meeting-houses, two charity schools,\r\n  and three fairs, and has
      on Saturday one of the best markets for wheat\r\n  in England. It gives the
      title of Duke to the noble family of\r\n  Beauclerc. The great John Duke of
      Marlborough erected a seat here,\r\n  called Holloway-house, and several neat
      alms-houses have been built\r\n  here by him and his Duchess.\r\n\r\n_St._ ALBAN\u2019S,
      _Wood street_, on the north side of London, and the east\r\n  side of Wood street,
      Cheapside, is dedicated to St. Alban, the British\r\n  Proto-Martyr, who suffered
      under the persecution of Dioclesian. The\r\n  first church in this place was
      erected in the year 930, and dedicated\r\n  to the same Saint. After various
      repairs, the old church was pulled\r\n  down in 1634, and another erected, which
      was destroyed by the fire of\r\n  London thirty-two years after, when the present
      edifice was built from\r\n  the same model as the former. It is entirely in
      the Gothic stile, and\r\n  consists of a spacious body, and a handsome tower
      with pinacles.\r\n\r\n  This church is a rectory in the patronage of Eton College,
      and the\r\n  parish of St. Olave, Silver street, is united to it. The Rector,\r\n
      \ besides other advantages, receives 170_l._ in lieu of tithes.\r\n\r\n  Munday
      in his edition of Stow mentions several uncommon epitaphs in\r\n  this church,
      from which we have only selected the following:\r\n\r\n                 Hic

      \ In the possession of Richard Mead, Esq; in Albemarle street, is a book\r\n
      \ bought out of the collection of the famous Cardinal Maximi at Rome; it\r\n
      \ contain 148 accurate and elegant paintings in water colours, done from\r\n
      \ ancient pictures found on the walls, ceilings and floors of the baths\r\n
      \ of Titus, and various other buildings in Rome, some of which have been\r\n
      \ engraved by Bartoli in his _Sepolchri di Nassoni_, and in other books:\r\n
      \ but many of them are to be seen no where else, neither engraved, nor\r\n  on
      the walls from whence they were first copied, where they are much\r\n  defaced
      by the weather, the smoke of torches, and other accidents.\r\n\r\n  Of these
      ancient paintings on wall, Mr. Mead has also a very elegant\r\n  little specimen
      representing Augustus restoring a crown to a conquered\r\n  Prince in the presence
      of several of his courtiers, among which the\r\n  faces of Mec\xE6nas and Horace
      may be distinguished.\u2014This has been\r\n  engraved and explained by Turnbull.\r\n\r\n
      \ An ancient Greek inscription, being eight lines of Hexameter and\r\n  Pentameter
      verses on a marble brought from Asia, which had been a\r\n  pedestal to a statue

      from the\r\n  Guildhall being anciently situated there, till falling to decay,
      the\r\n  present hall was built at the end of King street, about the year 1420.\r\n
      \ The old hall must have been very ancient, as this street had the name\r\n
      \ of Aldermanbury so early as before the year 1189; and Mr. Maitland\r\n  supposes
      that Edward the Confessor, who began his reign in 1042, had a\r\n  considerable

      and each has his separate\r\n  ward, to the government of which he is more immediately
      to attend.\r\n  Those who have served the office of Lord Mayor, are said to
      be above\r\n  the chair, and with three of the eldest that are next it, are
      justices\r\n  of the peace by charter. All the Aldermen keep their wardmote
      for\r\n  chusing ward officers, and settling the affairs of the ward; for\r\n
      \ redressing grievances, and presenting all defaults found in the ward.\r\n
      \ In the management of these affairs, every Alderman has his deputy,\r\n  chosen
      out of the common council, and in some of the wards, that are\r\n  very large,
      the Alderman has two deputies.\r\n\r\nALDERSGATE, which is situated 1265 feet
      south west of Cripplegate, is,\r\n  in Stow\u2019s opinion, one of the original
      gates of the city; but this is\r\n  disputed by Maitland, who observes, that
      the epithet of Alder does not\r\n  necessarily imply its antiquity, as some
      derive the name of the gate\r\n  from Aldrich, a Saxon; others from the seniors
      or old men by whom it\r\n  was built; and others from the great number of alder
      trees, which grew\r\n  in that neighbourhood; whence he imagines that either
      of these\r\n  opinions is more probable, than that this name was conferred upon
      it\r\n  on account of its age, particularly as it is no where found to be\r\n
      \ mentioned before the conquest.\r\n\r\n  The present gate was built in the
      year 1616, and being much damaged by\r\n  the fire of London, was repaired in
      1670. In a large square over the\r\n  arch is King James I. on horseback, in
      the same posture as when he\r\n  made his entry through this gate, on his coming
      to take possession of\r\n  the crown. The arms of England, Scotland, and Ireland,
      are quartered\r\n  above his head. In a nich on the east side is the prophet
      Jeremiah,\r\n  with the words of the 25th verse of the 17th chapter of his book;
      and\r\n  in a nich on the west side stands the prophet Samuel, with the first\r\n
      \ verse of the 12th chap. of 1 Sam. On the south side is King James I.\r\n  in
      his royal robes, sitting in a chair of state, done in relief. By\r\n  the sides
      of the gate there are two posterns for the convenience of\r\n  foot passengers:
      and the apartments above are appropriated to the use\r\n  of the common crier
      of the city.\r\n\r\n  A late author observes, that this gate is so heavy and
      Gothic a\r\n  structure, that it hardly deserves notice, unless for the sake
      of the\r\n  bass relief of King James, which, though in an aukward and inelegant\r\n
      \ taste, is a very tolerable piece of workmanship, and may challenge\r\n  some
      applause.\r\n\r\nALDERSGATE _bars_, in Goswell street, a little beyond the north
      end of\r\n  Aldersgate street, where the liberties of the city end on that side.\r\n\r\nALDERSGATE
      _street_, extends from the gate to the corner of Barbican.\r\n\r\nALDERSGATE
      WARD, is of considerable extent both within and without the\r\n  gate from which
      it is named, and extends in length from Blowbladder\r\n  street to Aldersgate
      bars, including part of Noble street, almost all\r\n  Foster lane, St. Martin\u2019s
      le Grand, Bull and Mouth street, Little\r\n  Britain, and Aldersgate street.
      The principal buildings are two\r\n  churches, St. Botolph\u2019s and St. Ann\u2019s,
      Goldsmiths-hall, Cooks-hall,\r\n  Coachmakers-hall, Shaftsbury house, a noble
      building now used for the\r\n  London lying-in hospital, and London-house. This
      ward is governed by\r\n  an Alderman, two Deputies, and eight Common Council
      Men; eight\r\n  constables, nine scavengers, nineteen wardmote inquest men and
      a\r\n  beadle. The jurymen returned by the wardmote inquest serve in the\r\n
      \ several courts in Guildhall in the month of August.\r\n\r\nALDGATE, was one
      of the four original gates of the city, and that\r\n  through which the Roman
      vicinal way led to the _trajectus_ or ferry at\r\n  Old Ford. Stow says, that
      it received its name from its antiquity,\r\n  which Maitland observes is very
      improbable, though he allows that the\r\n  Saxons might give it the epithet
      of _Eald_ or _Ald_, from the ruinous\r\n  condition in which they found it when
      they first possessed themselves\r\n  of this city. However, the first time it
      is found mentioned, is in a\r\n  charter granted by King Edgar about the year
      967.\r\n\r\n  Aldgate being very ruinous, was pulled down in the year 1606,
      and the\r\n  first stone of the present edifice was laid the next year; but
      this\r\n  work was not finished till 1609. It is observable that in digging
      the\r\n  foundation, several Roman coins were discovered, two of which Mr. Bond\r\n
      \ the surveyor caused to be cut on stone, and placed on each side of the\r\n
      \ east front. On the same side was placed in a large square the statue\r\n  of
      King James I. in gilt armour, with a golden lion and a chained\r\n  unicorn
      couchant at his feet. On the top of the gate was a vane\r\n  supported by a
      gilt sphere, on each side of which stood a soldier\r\n  holding a bullet in
      his hand, on the top of the upper battlements. On\r\n  the west side was a figure
      of Fortune gilt, and standing on a globe,\r\n  with a prosperous sail spreading
      over her head; under which was carved\r\n  the King\u2019s arms; some what lower
      on the south side stood Peace with a\r\n  dove perched on her hand, and a gilded
      wreath in the other; and on the\r\n  north side was the emblem of Charity. Over
      the arch of the gate was\r\n  also engraven,\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Senatus
      Populusque_ Londinensis\r\n                               _Fecit_ 1609\r\n                           HUMFREY

      of these ornaments\r\n  remain, except the representation of the two Roman coins,
      and the\r\n  inscription.\r\n\r\n  The apartments over this gate are appropriated
      to the use of one of\r\n  the Lord Mayor\u2019s carvers.\r\n\r\nALDGATE _high

      ALLEYN\u2019S ALMSHOUSE\r\n  in Lamb alley in Bishopsgate street. This charitable
      foundation, was\r\n  erected in Petty France by Edward Alleyn, a comedian, about
      the year\r\n  1614, and from thence removed to the above place upon the rebuilding\r\n
      \ of Petty France, now called New Broad street. Ten poor men and women\r\n  are,
      besides their lodging, allowed about 40_s._ _per annum_, and\r\n  every other
      year the men have coats and breeches, and the women gowns\r\n  and petticoats.
      _Maitland._\r\n\r\nALLEYN\u2019S ALMSHOUSE, in Pesthouse lane near Old street,
      was founded by\r\n  the above Edward Alleyn, about the year 1616, for ten poor
      men and\r\n  women; who receive 6_d._ per week each, and every other year coats
      and\r\n  gowns.\r\n\r\nALLEYN\u2019S ALMSHOUSE in Soap yard, Deadman\u2019s
      Place in Southwark, was also\r\n  founded by the above Edward Alleyn, about
      the year 1616, for ten poor\r\n  men and women, with an allowance of only 6_d._
      per week.\r\n\r\nALLHALLOWS _Barking_ church, at the east end of Tower street,
      is so\r\n  denominated from its being dedicated to all the Saints, vulgarly\r\n
      \ called Allhallows; and its anciently belonging to the Abbess and\r\n  Convent
      of Barking in Essex. It escaped the fire in 1666, and carries\r\n  about it
      the marks of that period when architecture was not well\r\n  understood in England.
      The church is of considerable extent, and the\r\n  steeple is a plain tower
      with its turret. It is a vicarage in the\r\n  patronage of the Archbishop of
      Canterbury. The Vicar, besides other\r\n  advantages, receives about 126_l._
      a year in tithes.\r\n\r\nALLHALLOWS _Bread street_. The old church was destroyed
      by the dreadful\r\n  conflagration which laid most of the other churches in
      ruins; and the\r\n  present edifice was erected in 1684. It consists of a plain
      body, and\r\n  a square tower divided into four stages with arches near the
      top. It\r\n  is a rectory, and one of the thirteen peculiars in this city belonging\r\n
      \ to the Archbishop of Canterbury.\r\n\r\n  The advowson of this church is in
      the Archbishop of Canterbury, and to\r\n  this parish that of St. John the Evangelist
      is united. The Vicar,\r\n  besides glebes, casualties, annual donations, and
      other advantages,\r\n  receives 1401. a year in lieu of tithes. _Maitland._\r\n\r\n
      \ The following monumental inscripton in this church is worthy of a\r\n  place
      in this work. It is to the memory of Humfrey Levins, a citizen\r\n  and grocer
      of London, who died in 1682, in the fifty-third year of his\r\n  age, and his
      son Humfrey, a youth aged fourteen, who died in 1677, and\r\n  lies buried in
      the same grave.\r\n\r\n              Which shall we weep? both merit tears;
      yet sure\r\n              Tears are but vain, where bliss is so secure.\r\n
      \             Which shall we praise? our eulogy can\u2019t add\r\n              Unto
      the bless\u2019d, who God\u2019s kind euge had.\r\n              Our duty\u2019s
      but to imitate and admire\r\n              This happy pair of the celestial
      choir.\r\n\r\nALLHALLOWS _the Great_, situated on the south side of Thames street,
      was\r\n  anciently denominated _Allhallows the More_, and _Allhallows ad F\u0153num_\r\n
      \ in the _Ropery_, from its vicinity to a hay-wharf or market, and\r\n  situation
      among ropemakers. The old church with a large cloister on\r\n  the south side,
      were consumed in the general conflagration in 1666,\r\n  and the present edifice
      arose in 1683. It was built on Sir Christopher\r\n  Wren\u2019s plan; but in
      some parts the mason has taken inexcusable\r\n  liberties. The church is 87
      feet in length, 60 in breadth, and the\r\n  height to the roof is 33. It is
      built of stone, and there runs thro\u2019\r\n  the whole, an apparent strength
      and solidity. The walls are plain and\r\n  massy, the ornaments are few and
      simple, and the apertures, tho\u2019\r\n  large, in order to enlighten so considerable
      a breadth, are not\r\n  numerous. The tower is plain, square, and divided into
      five stages,\r\n  but terminates absolutely square and plain, without spire,
      turret or\r\n  pinacles. The cornice is supported by scrolls, and over these
      rises a\r\n  balustrade of solid construction, very proper for the rest of the\r\n
      \ building. _Maitland, and English Architecture._\r\n\r\n  Among the funeral
      monuments in this church, before its being burnt,\r\n  was one in memory of
      Queen Elizabeth, with the following inscriptions:\r\n\r\n       If royal virtues
      ever crown\u2019d a crown;\r\n         If ever mildness shin\u2019d in majesty;\r\n

      the thirteen peculiars belonging\r\n  to the Archbishop of Canterbury; and to
      this parish that of Allhallows\r\n  the Less is annexed, by which the profits
      of the Rector are greatly\r\n  increased. He receives, besides glebes, &c. 200_l._
      _per annum_ in\r\n  lieu of tithes.\r\n\r\nALLHALLOWS _Honey lane_, a small
      church, which stood where the east end\r\n  of Honey lane market is at present
      situated; but being destroyed by\r\n  the fire of London in 1666, the parish
      was by act of parliament united\r\n  to the church of St. Mary le Bow.\r\n\r\nALLHALLOWS
      _the Less_, stood on the south side of Thames street, almost\r\n  adjoining
      to that of Allhallows the Great; but having suffered in the\r\n  common calamity
      in 1666, the parish was united to that of Allhallows\r\n  the Great.\r\n\r\nALLHALLOWS
      _Lombard street_, situated in Bell alley, near the north\r\n  corner of Lombard
      street, in Langbourn ward. A church stood here under\r\n  the same patronage,
      before the year 1053; but the present plain,\r\n  well-proportioned building,
      was erected in the room of that destroyed\r\n  by the fire of London. The body
      is enlightened by a single series of\r\n  large windows, and the tower is terminated
      by a plain battlement.\r\n\r\n  This church is a rectory, and one of the thirteen
      peculiars in this\r\n  city belonging to the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Rector,
      besides\r\n  glebes, donations, and casualties, receives 110_l._ a year in lieu

      a little to the east of\r\n  Bethlem Hospital, on the outside of London wall.
      It escaped the fire\r\n  in 1666, and is a rectory, in the King\u2019s gift.\r\n\r\nALLHALLOWS
      _Staining_, situated near the north end of Mark lane. It is\r\n  said to obtain
      the name of Staining, from the corruption of the word\r\n  _stoney_, because
      built at first of stone, when the other churches\r\n  dedicated to all the Saints
      were of wood. It escaped the fire in 1666.\r\n  The body is well illuminated
      with Gothic windows, and the square tower\r\n  is crowned with a small turret.\r\n\r\n
      \ This church is a curacy, in the gift of the Grocers company. The\r\n  curate

      or AGMONDESHAM, a small but very ancient borough, in\r\n  Buckinghamshire, situated
      in a vale between woody hills, 29 miles from\r\n  London. This town does not
      come within the compass which we have\r\n  prescribed round London, but our
      map of the environs not being a\r\n  circle, the angles of it take in some few
      places at a greater distance\r\n  than 20 miles; and these being inserted in
      our map, we thought we\r\n  could not dispense with taking notice of them, as
      well as of those\r\n  within the prescribed limits. The town consists of a long
      street,\r\n  divided about the middle by a shorter cross street; in the\r\n
      \ intersection of which stands the church, said to be the best rectory\r\n  in
      the county; it being well endowed by Geoffery de Mandeville, Earl\r\n  of Essex,
      in the reign of King Stephen. There is here a handsome\r\n  market-house, built
      with brick on arched pillars, about 80 years ago,\r\n  by Sir William Drake,
      Knt. It has a free school founded in the reign\r\n  of Queen Elizabeth; and
      here is also a fine seat called Shardelowes,\r\n  the manor of which formerly
      belonged to the noble family of the\r\n  Russels; but about the time of the
      restoration it was sold, with the\r\n  borough, to Sir William Drake, Bart.

      provision for their\r\n  wives, children, and other relations, after an easy,
      certain and\r\n  advantageous manner, with power to purchase lands, &c. and
      to have a\r\n  seal, which is a dove standing upon a serpent, and above in a
      scroll\r\n  the motto PRUDENS SIMPLICITAS. The number of persons to be\r\n  incorporated
      was not to exceed 2000. After paying the charges of the\r\n  policy, and 10_s._
      entrance-money, each person was to pay 6_l._ 4_s._\r\n  _per annum_, which annual
      payments have since, by the increase of the\r\n  Society\u2019s stock, been
      reduced to 5_l._ a year, payable quarterly, and\r\n  from these payments the
      dividends to claimants are to arise.\r\n\r\n  That this Society has been greatly
      beneficial to the public, evidently\r\n  appears from a state of their yearly
      dividends from Lady-day 1710, to\r\n  Lady 1757, during which each claim amounted
      upon an average to 106_l._\r\n  1_s._ 4_d._ but taking the computation only
      for these twenty-three\r\n  years last past, _viz._ from the year 1734, (when
      by an order of the\r\n  general court, a part of their yearly income was appropriated
      for\r\n  augmenting their claims whenever they should happen to be under\r\n
      \ 100_l._) the quantum of such claims from the year 1734 to 1757, have\r\n  amounted
      upon an average to 120_l._ 9_s._ 1_d._ and so considerable\r\n  has been the
      increase of the dividends for these nine years last past,\r\n  that each claim,
      during that period, has been advanced upon an average\r\n  to 142_l._ 6_s._
      5_d._\r\n\r\n  However, at a general court held May 12, 1757, an order was made
      for\r\n  farther augmenting the dividends on claims, so as that for the future\r\n
      \ they will not be less than 125_l._ each claim, but yet may happen to\r\n  be
      considerably more, which has been the case of several former years.\r\n\r\n
      \ The advantages from becoming members of this society are such as\r\n  follow:\r\n\r\n
      \ To clergymen, physicians, surgeons, lawyers, tradesmen, and\r\n  particularly
      persons possessed of places or employments for life: to\r\n  such parents, husbands,
      or wives, and other relations, whose income is\r\n  subject to be determined
      or diminished at their respective deaths, who\r\n  by insuring their lives by
      means of this Society, may now in all\r\n  events leave to their families a
      claim, or right, to receive a sum not\r\n  less than 125_l._ for every five
      pounds annually paid in, and very\r\n  probably a larger sum, as appears by
      the above account.\r\n\r\n  To married persons, more especially where a jointure,
      pension, or\r\n  annuity depends on both or either of their lives, by insuring
      the life\r\n  of the persons intitled to such annuity, pension or jointure.\r\n\r\n
      \ To dependents upon any other person intitled to a salary, benefaction,\r\n
      \ or other means of subsistence, during the life of such person, whose\r\n  life
      being insured in this society, either by themselves, or by the\r\n  person upon
      whom they are dependent, will intitle them to receive upon\r\n  the death of
      such person, a sum not less than 125_l._ for each number\r\n  so insured.\r\n\r\n
      \ To persons wanting to borrow money, who by insuring their lives, are\r\n  enabled
      to give a collateral security for the money borrowed.\r\n\r\n  To creditors
      intitled to demands larger than their debtors are able to\r\n  discharge, such
      debtors may, by a like insurance, secure to their\r\n  creditors their principal
      sums at their deaths.\r\n\r\n  The abovementioned advantages are chiefly with
      respect to perpetual\r\n  insurances for life; but temporary insurers may find
      no less advantage\r\n  from this Society, as may plainly appear from the following
      instance,\r\n  _viz._ _A. B._ has agreed for the purchase of an office or employment,\r\n
      \ but wants 300_l._ or 400_l._ to make up the purchase-money: he is\r\n  willing
      to assign a share of the profits or income of his office, as a\r\n  security
      or pledge for the repayment of the principal with interest,\r\n  but cannot
      obtain a loan of that sum without insuring his life till\r\n  the whole be cleared,
      which he is enabled to do by the help of this\r\n  Society. For example; He
      purchases three numbers, on each of which he\r\n  insures his life, and thereby
      his assigns become intitled to three\r\n  several claims at his death; which
      claims, by the abovementioned\r\n  provision, will not be less than 125_l._
      each, and may probably amount\r\n  to more: he assigns and deposits his policy
      with the lender: he pays\r\n  to the Society for the yearly contributions on
      the three numbers no\r\n  more than 5_l._ each, which is considerably less than
      5_l._ _per\r\n  cent._ under which rate no other office will insure, and that
      for one\r\n  year only; at the end of which such offices are at liberty to refuse\r\n
      \ any further insurance: whereas in this Society the insurance continues\r\n
      \ during the life of the insured, unless excluded by the non-payment of\r\n
      \ the quarterly contributions. And every insurer, or their\r\n  representatives,
      at the end of their insurance may in a great measure\r\n  (if not entirely)
      reimburse themselves their purchase-money\r\n  (originally paid by them for
      their numbers) by disposing of them at a\r\n  market price, which they may do
      without any farther trouble than\r\n  applying to the Society\u2019s office.\r\n\r\n
      \ The regulations of the Society are as follow:\r\n\r\n  All persons at the
      time of their admission are to be between the ages\r\n  of twelve and forty-five,
      and must then appear to be in a good state\r\n  of health.\r\n\r\n  Persons
      living in the country may be admitted by certificates and\r\n  affidavit, forms
      of which may be had at the office.\r\n\r\n  Every claimant is impowered to put
      in a new life in the room of the\r\n  deceased within twelve calendar months
      next after the end of the\r\n  current year, for which his or her claim shall
      be allowed as often as\r\n  the same shall happen, upon payment of 10_s._ entrance.\r\n\r\n
      \ Any person may have two or three several insurances, or numbers, on\r\n  one
      and the same life, whereby such persons will be intitled to a\r\n  claim on
      each number so insured.\r\n\r\n  The affairs of the corporation are managed
      by a court of twelve\r\n  directors annually chosen within forty days after
      every 25th of March;\r\n  and the majority of the members assembled at a general
      court, which is\r\n  never to consist of less than twenty, are impowered to
      make laws and\r\n  ordinances for the good government of the corporation. The
      charter\r\n  directs one of the members of the Society to be elected their\r\n
      \ Register, who being also their receiver and accomptant, is therefore\r\n  required
      by the by-laws to give good security in the sum of 2000_l._\r\n  at least.\r\n\r\n
      \ Five members of the Society are annually elected auditors, who are by\r\n
      \ their office to inspect every transaction of the Society, to examine\r\n  all
      vouchers for receipts and payments, and upon oath to lay before\r\n  the quarterly
      and annual general courts, the quarterly and annual\r\n  accounts of the Society:
      and on the day before the holding each court\r\n  of directors, the auditors
      are to state and enter in the directors\r\n  minute book a balance of the cash
      of the Society.\r\n\r\n  Attendance is daily given at the Society\u2019s office
      from nine in the\r\n  morning, till two in the afternoon, holidays excepted.

      not inelegant church, situated on\r\n  the south side of Holborn, and at the
      corner of Shoe lane. It is\r\n  dedicated to St. Andrew the Apostle, who was
      distinguished by being\r\n  the first person Christ called for a disciple; and
      his suffering\r\n  martyrdom in Achaia. There was a church in this place called
      by the\r\n  name of the same Apostle, so early as the year 1297. The old church\r\n
      \ escaped the flames in the dreadful fire of London, that proved fatal\r\n  to
      so many others; but ten years after being found too ruinous for\r\n  repair,
      was taken down in 1687, and the present structure erected in\r\n  its place,
      except the tower, which was not finished till the year\r\n  1704.\r\n\r\n  This
      church has a considerable space before it, which is entered by a\r\n  handsome
      pair of iron gates. It is a neat edifice, with two series of\r\n  windows, and
      a handsome balustrade round the top. The tower, which\r\n  rises square, consists
      only of two stages, and round the top is a\r\n  balustrade with a pinacle at
      each corner; on the crown of each is\r\n  placed a pine apple, from which rises
      the fanes. On the inside, the\r\n  church is extremely neat and well finished.\r\n\r\n
      \ The living is a rectory, said to be worth 600_l._ a year, in the\r\n  patronage
      of the Duke of Montague. _Stow, Maitland, English\r\n  architecture._\r\n\r\n_St._

      \ and Love lane, in Little Eastcheap, where the King\u2019s weigh-house now\r\n
      \ stands; but being destroyed by the fire of London, and not rebuilt,\r\n  the
      parish was united to that of St. Mary at Hill.\r\n\r\n_St._ ANDREW _Undershaft_,
      at the corner of St. Mary Ax in Leadenhall\r\n  street, and in Aldgate ward.
      There stood in this place a church\r\n  dedicated to the same Saint so early
      as in 1362, which was pulled down\r\n  in the year 1532, and the present structure
      erected in its room. It\r\n  obtained the name of _Undershaft_ from a may-pole,
      which was anciently\r\n  called a shaft, being annually raised in the street
      near it on\r\n  May-day, and was taller than the steeple.\r\n\r\n  This church
      is a plain gothic structure, with a well enlightened body,\r\n  and a square
      tower terminated by battlements, with pinacles at the\r\n  corners, within which
      rises a turret that contains the bell. It is a\r\n  rectory, in the patronage
      of the Bishop of London. The Incumbent\r\n  receives 120_l._ a year by tithes.\r\n\r\n_St._
      ANDREW _Wardrobe_, on the east side of Puddledock hill, in Castle\r\n  Baynard
      ward, took its name from a great royal wardrobe erected there\r\n  in the reign
      of King Edward III. There was a church on the same spot\r\n  dedicated to St.
      Andrew in the year 1322: but the present structure\r\n  was not built till the
      year 1670, when it was erected in the place of\r\n  one burnt by the fire of
      London. The body is enlightened by two rows\r\n  of windows, and the tower has
      neither turret, pinacles nor spire.\r\n\r\n  This church is a rectory, in the
      gift of the Crown, and to this parish\r\n  that of St. Ann\u2019s Black Friars
      is annexed. The Rector receives by act\r\n  of parliament 140_l._ a year in

      side of St. Ann\u2019s lane, in the\r\n  ward of Aldersgate within, is dedicated
      to St. Ann the mother of the\r\n  Virgin Mary. The old church in this place
      perished in the fire 1666,\r\n  and the present was raised in its place about
      three years after. It is\r\n  a very plain edifice: the body is enlightened
      by a few large windows,\r\n  cased with rustic. The tower, which is very plain,
      is also\r\n  strengthened at the corners with rustic, and from its top rises
      a\r\n  turret and spire.\r\n\r\n  The church is a rectory in the patronage of
      the Bishop of London, and\r\n  the parish of St. John Zachary is annexed to
      it. The Rector receives\r\n  140_l._ _per annum_, in lieu of tithes.\r\n\r\n_St._
      ANN\u2019S _Black Friars_, stood on the east side of Churchyard alley,\r\n  in
      the precinct of Black Friars, and the ward of Faringdon without;\r\n  but having
      suffered in the fatal calamity of 1666, and not being\r\n  rebuilt, the parish
      was annexed to that St. Andrew Wardrobe.\r\n\r\n_St._ ANN\u2019S _Limehouse_,
      arose from the great increase of houses and\r\n  inhabitants, by which the village
      of Limehouse, a hamlet of Stepney,\r\n  became joined to the metropolis, and
      it was resolved that here should\r\n  be one of the fifty new churches appointed
      by act of parliament to be\r\n  built within the bills of mortality. The foundation
      was laid in the\r\n  year 1712, and the present structure finished in 1729;
      but the\r\n  inhabitants of this hamlet not applying to parliament to have it\r\n
      \ erected into a parish till the year 1729, it was not consecrated till\r\n
      \ 1730. This hamlet and part of that of Ratcliff, having been\r\n  constituted
      a distinct parish from that of Stepney, the sum of\r\n  3500_l._ was given by
      parliament to be laid out in fee simple towards\r\n  the support of the Rector;
      besides which the church wardens were to\r\n  pay him annually the sum of 60_l._
      to be raised by burial fees.\r\n\r\n  This church is of a very singular construction,
      the body is not one\r\n  plain building, but is continued under separate portions.
      The door\r\n  under the tower has a portico, covered with a dome supported by\r\n
      \ pilasters, and to this door there is an ascent by a flight of plain\r\n  steps.
      Its square tower has a large Corinthian window adorned with\r\n  columns and
      pilasters. The corners of the tower are also strengthened\r\n  by pilasters,
      which on their tops support vases. The upper stage of\r\n  the tower is plain,
      and extremely heavy, and from this part rises a\r\n  turret at each corner,
      and a more lofty one in the middle.\r\n\r\n  The advowson of this rectory, which
      is not to be held in commendam, is\r\n  in the Principal and Scholars of King\u2019s
      hall, and Brazen-nose College,\r\n  Oxford. _Maitland._\r\n\r\n_St._ ANN\u2019S
      _Soho_, owes its foundation to the same cause as the former,\r\n  the increase
      of public buildings; the inhabitants of the parish of St.\r\n  Martin\u2019s
      in the Fields became much too numerous to be contained in the\r\n  church, and
      therefore applying to parliament, this was erected in the\r\n  year 1686, in
      a spot of ground then called Kemp\u2019s Field, and the\r\n  parish to which
      it belongs was separated from St. Martin\u2019s in 1678.\r\n\r\n  The walls
      of this church are of brick with rustic quoins. The tower,\r\n  which is square,
      is strengthened with a kind of buttresses, and at the\r\n  springing of the
      dome, which supports the lanthorn, there are urns on\r\n  the corners with flames.
      The lanthorn, which is formed of arches, is\r\n  surrounded with a balustrade
      at the bottom, and a turret over it is\r\n  well shaped, and crowned with a
      globe and fane.\r\n\r\n  The advowson of this church is settled upon the Bishop
      of London, and\r\n  the Rector; instead of tithes, receives from the parishioners
      100_l._\r\n  a year, which, together with the glebe, surplice fees, and Easter\r\n

      formed in this city\r\n  about the year 1580, by some of the most learned men
      in the kingdom:\r\n  but having been frequently interrupted and discontinued,
      very little\r\n  can be said concerning the same till the year 1717, when it
      was again\r\n  revived by a number of gentlemen studious of antiquity in general,
      but\r\n  more particularly desirous to obtain all possible knowledge of the\r\n
      \ antiquities of their own country. With this view they agreed to meet\r\n  one
      evening in every week under certain regulations; they encouraged\r\n  correspondencies
      with all parts of the kingdom; they subscribed an\r\n  annual sum to defray
      the expence of engraving on copper-plates, what\r\n  should be thought deserving
      to be so preserved, and limited their\r\n  number to 100. And in this manner
      they continued their weekly meeting\r\n  with great reputation, till his Majesty
      King George II. was graciously\r\n  pleased to grant them a royal charter of
      incorporation, dated Nov. 2,\r\n  1751; and to declare himself their founder
      and patron.\r\n\r\n  Under this charter they became a body corporate, by the
      name of the\r\n  Society of Antiquaries of London, with a power to have and
      use a\r\n  common seal, to sue and be sued, and to take, hold, and enjoy by\r\n
      \ purchase, gift, or otherwise, any lands, tenements or hereditaments,\r\n  not
      exceeding in the whole 1000_l._ _per annum_. And it is therein\r\n  directed,
      that the Council of the said Society shall at all times\r\n  consist of 21 persons,
      the President for the time being always to be\r\n  one; and the said charter
      appoints Martin Folkes, Esq; to be the first\r\n  President, and also 20 other
      persons therein named to be the first\r\n  Council, empowering them within two
      months from the date thereof, to\r\n  nominate, chuse and admit, as Fellows
      of the said Society, such\r\n  persons as shall excel in the knowledge of the
      antiquities and history\r\n  of this and other nations, and be eminent for piety,
      virtue, integrity\r\n  and loyalty. This first President and Council are to
      continue till the\r\n  23d day of April next ensuing, on which day, in every
      year thereafter,\r\n  the Council and Fellows are to assemble to nominate and
      elect a\r\n  President, and Council for the ensuing year; and it is particularly\r\n
      \ directed that eleven of the former Council shall be continued, and ten\r\n
      \ other persons chosen out of the members of the Society: ten and no\r\n  more
      of the Council being to be changed annually. The President is\r\n  empowered
      to nominate four persons of the Council to be his Deputies,\r\n  and supply
      his place in case of sickness or absence, and the\r\n  President, Council, Fellows,
      or any twenty-one or more, are empowered\r\n  to make statutes, rules, orders
      and by-laws, for the government and\r\n  direction of the said Society, their
      estates, goods, &c. and for the\r\n  admission and amoval of all and every the
      members and officers\r\n  thereof. And the President, Council and Fellows, may
      appoint\r\n  treasurers, secretaries and clerks, may have and employ one serjeant\r\n
      \ at mace, and such other servants as they think necessary. And lastly,\r\n
      \ if any abuses or differences shall arise, the Archbishop of\r\n  Canterbury,
      the Lord Chancellor or Keeper of the Great Seal, the Lord\r\n  Privy Seal, and
      the two Secretaries of State for the time being, are\r\n  appointed Visitors,
      with full power for any three of them to compose\r\n  and redress such differences
      and abuses: provision is also made to\r\n  fill up any vacancies that may happen
      by the death of the President or\r\n  any of the Council.\r\n\r\n  On the receipt
      of this charter, the first President and Council\r\n  nominated and admitted,
      by a writing dated the 14th of November 1751,\r\n  all the former members, together
      with some others, in the whole 121,\r\n  to be Fellows of the said Society of
      Antiquaries of London, and soon\r\n  after drew up a body of statutes for the
      good government thereof,\r\n  which, was unanimously agreed to and confirmed
      in the month of July\r\n  1752.\r\n\r\n  It was herein enacted, that the number
      of members should not exceed\r\n  150, but that number being very soon filled
      up, and several men of\r\n  quality and fortune, as well as persons of great
      learning and\r\n  eminence, being continually applying to become members, which
      they\r\n  could not be till vacancies should happen by death, the Society\r\n
      \ thought proper in the year 1755, to enlarge their number to 180, (to\r\n  which
      they are limited at present) exclusive of Peers, Privy\r\n  Councillors and
      Judges, that should be chosen after that time. A\r\n  little before this the
      Society gave up the management of their estate\r\n  and revenues, the payment
      of monies, and the publication of their\r\n  papers and drawings, (which before
      were in the body in general, and\r\n  thereby attended with many inconveniences,)
      entirely to the care of\r\n  their Council, which are now a standing committee
      for that purpose;\r\n  and thereby the government of this Society is become
      nearly the same\r\n  as that of the Royal Society, which was doubtless a proper
      pattern to\r\n  copy after.\r\n\r\n  On the 23d of April, being St. George\u2019s
      day, the Society annually\r\n  elect their Council and officers, _viz._ a President,
      a Treasurer, two\r\n  Secretaries, and a Director, who has the care of all their\r\n
      \ publications. Then the President appoints four of the Council to be\r\n  his
      Deputies or Vice-presidents: and after the election is over, the\r\n  Society
      dine together at their own expence. Martin Folkes, Esq; was\r\n  annually elected
      President till his death in 1754, since which time\r\n  the Rt. Hon. Lord Willoughby
      of Parham has been every year chosen.\r\n\r\n  Every person desirous to be elected
      a Fellow of this Society, except\r\n  Peers, Privy Counsellors, or Judges of
      Great Britain or Ireland, must\r\n  be recommended by three or more of the members,
      in a paper signed by\r\n  themselves, specifying the name, addition, profession,
      and chief\r\n  qualification of the candidate, and also the place of his abode.
      When\r\n  this has been read at one of the Society\u2019s meetings, and then
      hung up\r\n  in their public room during the time of four other meetings, the\r\n
      \ election is determined by ballot. Peers, Privy Counsellors, and judges\r\n
      \ of Great Britain or Ireland, if proposed by any single member, must be\r\n
      \ balloted for immediately. Every new member must pay an admission fee\r\n  of
      five guineas, and sign the obligation, whereby he promises, that he\r\n  will
      to the utmost of his power promote the honour and interest of the\r\n  Society,
      and observe the statutes and orders thereof. Which being done\r\n  he is led
      up to the chair, when the President or Vice-President\r\n  rising, takes him
      by the hand and says these words, _viz._ I do, by\r\n  the authority and in
      the name of the Society of Antiquaries of London,\r\n  admit you a Fellow thereof.\r\n\r\n
      \ Every member must further pay one guinea annually for the use of the\r\n  Society,
      or ten guineas at once in lieu of all contributions.\r\n\r\n  The meetings of
      this Society are on Thursday evenings weekly, from\r\n  about six till nine
      o\u2019clock, at their house in Chancery lane: their\r\n  business is to receive,
      read and consider all informations from their\r\n  own members, or others, concerning
      the Antiquities of all nations,\r\n  (for which purpose they admit eminent foreigners
      to be correspondent\r\n  members) but they more particularly attend to the study
      of the ancient\r\n  history, customs, manners, grants, charters, coins, medals,
      camps,\r\n  churches, cities, and all monuments whatever, ecclesiastical,\r\n
      \ military, or civil, which are found in or relate to Great Britain and\r\n
      \ Ireland. And the communications they have received concerning these\r\n  matters
      must be very valuable, as may be judged by the many curious\r\n  remains of
      antiquity they have caused to be engraven on copper-plates,\r\n  and permitted
      lately to be sold; tho\u2019 as yet they have not thought fit\r\n  to publish
      any of their dissertations. They have a small but choice\r\n  library, which
      is increasing daily, also a fine collection of prints\r\n  and drawings.\r\n\r\n\r\n

      COMPANY. This company was incorporated with that of the\r\n  Grocers by King
      James I. in the year 1606; but they were soon\r\n  separated, and in 1617 incorporated
      by the name of the Master, Wardens\r\n  and Society of the art and mystery of
      Apothecaries of the city of\r\n  London, at which time there were only 104 Apothecaries
      shops within\r\n  the city and suburbs.\r\n\r\n  This company is governed by
      a Master, two Wardens, and twenty-one\r\n  Assistants, to whom belong a livery
      of 144 members, whose fine is\r\n  16_l._ The Apothecaries have the privilege
      of being exempt from parish\r\n  and ward offices.\r\n\r\nAPOTHECARIES HALL.
      This edifice is situated in Blackfriars, and has a\r\n  pair of gates leading
      into an open court handsomely paved with broad\r\n  stones, at the upper end
      of which is the hall built with brick and\r\n  stone, and adorned with columns
      of the Tuscan order. The ceiling of\r\n  the court room and hall is ornamented
      with fret work, and the latter\r\n  wainscotted fourteen feet high. In the hall
      room is the portraiture of\r\n  King James I. and also the bust of Dr. Gideon
      Delaun, that King\u2019s\r\n  apothecary, who was a considerable benefactor
      to the company. In this\r\n  building are two large laboratories, one chemical,
      and the other for\r\n  galenical preparations, where vast quantities of the
      best medicines\r\n  are prepared, for the use of apothecaries and others, and
      particularly\r\n  of the Surgeons of the royal navy, who here make up their
      chests.\r\n\r\n  The Apothecaries company have a spacious and beautiful physic
      garden\r\n  at Chelsea, which contains almost four acres, and is enriched with
      a\r\n  vast variety of plants both domestic and exotic. This was given by Sir\r\n
      \ Hans Sloane, Bart. on condition of their paying a quit rent of 5_l._\r\n  _per
      annum_, and annually delivering to the President and Fellows of\r\n  the Royal
      Society, at one of their public meetings, fifty specimens of\r\n  different
      sorts of plants, well cured, and of the growth of this\r\n  garden, till the
      number of specimens amounts to 2000.\r\n\r\nAPPLEBY\u2019S _court_, Barnaby

      \ part of Hertfordshire, it has five archdeaconries, _viz._ those of\r\n  London,
      Essex, Middlesex, Colchester, and St. Alban\u2019s. It is the\r\n  office of
      these Archdeacons to visit annually the several cures in\r\n  their respective
      archdeaconries, in order to enquire into the\r\n  deportment of the several
      incumbents, as well as parish officers; to\r\n  advise them gravely to reform
      what is amiss, and in case of contumacy\r\n  to inflict pains and penalties,
      for which they receive procuration\r\n  from every parish priest within their
      jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nARCHES, an ecclesiastical court in Doctors Commons, formerly
      kept in Bow\r\n  church Cheapside, where the church and tower being arched,

      As\r\n  this is the highest court belonging to the Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\n
      \ hither all appeals in ecclesiastical matters within that province are\r\n

      GROUND. The Old Artillery Ground was a little north east of\r\n  what is now
      Devonshire square in Bishopsgate street. This was\r\n  originally a spacious
      field called Tassel Close, from its being\r\n  planted with tassels for the
      use of the clothworkers. It was\r\n  afterwards let to the cross-bow makers,
      who used to shoot there; but\r\n  being at length inclosed with a brick wall,
      served as an artillery\r\n  ground, to which the gunners of the Tower repaired
      every Thursday,\r\n  when they levelled brass pieces of large artillery against
      a butt of\r\n  earth raised for that purpose. The last Prior of St. Mary Spital\r\n
      \ granted to the gunners of the Tower this artillery ground for thrice\r\n  ninety
      nine years, for the use and practice of great and small\r\n  artillery; and
      King Henry VIII. gave the company a charter. Hence this\r\n  artillery ground
      became subject to the Tower; the streets, &c. compose\r\n  one of the Tower
      hamlets, and the inhabitants are still summoned on\r\n  juries belonging to
      the courts held on Tower hill.\r\n\r\n  In the year 1585, the city being put
      to great trouble and expence by\r\n  the continual musters and training of soldiers,
      some brave and active\r\n  citizens, who had obtained experience both at home
      and abroad,\r\n  voluntarily exercised themselves, and trained up others in
      the use of\r\n  arms, so that within two years there were almost three hundred\r\n
      \ merchants, and other persons of distinction, qualified to teach the\r\n  common
      soldiers the management of their guns, pikes, and halberts, as\r\n  well as
      to march and countermarch. These met every Thursday, each\r\n  person by turns
      bearing office from the corporal to the captain, and\r\n  some of these gentlemen
      had the honour of having a body of forces\r\n  under their command at the great
      camp of Tilbury, in the year 1588,\r\n  when the Spaniards sent against us their
      pretended invincible Armada,\r\n  and these commanders were generally called
      Captains of the Artillery\r\n  Garden.\r\n\r\n  This noble exercise became afterwards
      discontinued for a long time,\r\n  but was renewed in the year 1610, when several
      gentlemen having\r\n  obtained the permission of King James I. undertook at
      their private\r\n  expence a weekly exercise in the same artillery ground, and
      in the\r\n  year 1662, erected an armoury, in which they placed 500 sets of
      arms,\r\n  of extraordinary beauty and workmanship. The Artillery company now\r\n
      \ greatly increased, and the people resorted to the artillery ground to\r\n
      \ learn to defend themselves and their country; and even many gentlemen\r\n
      \ from every county went thither to learn martial exercises, in order to\r\n
      \ teach them to the militia, in the distant parts of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n  At
      length this company being so much increased that this artillery\r\n  ground
      was scarcely able to contain them, for they amounted to about\r\n  6000: they
      removed to the New Artillery Ground near the upper end of\r\n  Moorfields, where
      they still continue to assemble.\r\n\r\n  King Charles II. when Prince of Wales
      enlisted himself into this\r\n  company, as did his brother James Duke of York,
      at the same time; who\r\n  after the restoration took upon himself the command,
      and named it his\r\n  own company.\r\n\r\n  The Artillery company consists of
      about 300 men. It is governed by a\r\n  President, Vice-president, Treasurer
      and Court of Assistants. The Lord\r\n  Mayor, Aldermen and Sheriffs for the
      time being, &c. with the Field\r\n  Officers of the militia or trained bands,
      are of the honorary court,\r\n  these with 24 gentlemen annually elected, compose
      the court of\r\n  Assistants. His Majesty is Captain-General, and all the other
      officers\r\n  are elected annually, and serve by rotation.\r\n\r\n  The New
      Artillery Ground is a spacious square walled round. In the\r\n  center of the
      north side is the Armoury, a neat building of brick and\r\n  stone strengthened
      with rustic quoins at the corners; before it is a\r\n  flight of steps, and
      there are a few others at the door, which is in\r\n  the center, and is large,
      lofty, and adorned with a porch formed by\r\n  two Tuscan columns and two pilasters
      supporting a balcony. The front\r\n  is ornamented with a pediment supported
      at the corners by quoins. On\r\n  the top are placed several large balls, and
      on the apex of the\r\n  pediment is a lofty flag staff. On each side the main
      building, stands\r\n  at some distance backwards a small edifice, where the
      provisions are\r\n  dress\u2019d at the company\u2019s feasts. The hall of the
      armoury is hung round\r\n  with breast-plates, helmets and drums; and fronting
      the entrance is a\r\n  handsome pair of iron gates which lead to a spacious
      staircase,\r\n  painted with military ornaments, and adorned with the statue
      of a man\r\n  dressed in a compleat suit of armour. This staircase leads into
      a very\r\n  spacious room, which has the King\u2019s arms over one fire place,
      and\r\n  those of the company over the other. It has two chandeliers, and is\r\n
      \ adorned with very fine guns, swords and bayonets, presented by the\r\n  officers
      of the company, and handsomely disposed on the walls. There\r\n  are here also
      tables hung up, containing the names of the subscribers\r\n  to the iron gates
      and other ornaments, among whom is King George I.\r\n  who gave 500_l._ Besides
      the rooms already mentioned, there are two\r\n  others above, and two below.\r\n\r\nARTILLERY

      \ _Society for the encouragement of_ ARTS, MANUFACTURES _and_ COMMERCE.\r\n
      \ The public spirit of this age is perhaps in no instance more\r\n  remarkably
      shewn than in the flourishing condition of this valuable\r\n  Society, whose
      sole object is the improvement of the polite and\r\n  commercial arts in all
      their various branches, by exciting industry\r\n  and emulation amongst all
      who can be moved either by honorary or\r\n  pecuniary rewards. It was set on
      foot by Lord Folkstone, Lord Romney,\r\n  Dr. Hales, and seven or eight private
      gentlemen, who were brought\r\n  together by the unwearied pains of Mr. William
      Shipley, a person\r\n  little known, who had long laboured to reduce into practice
      a scheme\r\n  he had projected for this purpose. Their first meeting was at\r\n
      \ Rathmill\u2019s coffee-house, March 22d 1754, when those noble Lords\r\n  approved
      and patronized the undertaking. At their next meeting they\r\n  determined to
      make a beginning, by proposing rewards for the discovery\r\n  of cobalt, for
      the encouragement of boys and girls in the art of\r\n  drawing, (thereby to
      improve manufactures in taste and elegance,) and\r\n  for the planting of madder
      in this kingdom. And now money being\r\n  wanted, a voluntary subscription was
      begun, to which the two noblemen\r\n  before named, did not only generously
      contribute much more than they\r\n  would let appear, but engaged moreover to
      make good the deficiencies\r\n  at the end of the year: a promise they most
      honourably fulfilled. Soon\r\n  after this, a plan was drawn up by one of the
      members (Mr. Baker) for\r\n  forming, regulating and governing the Society,
      which being printed and\r\n  dispersed, the great utility of such a society
      became so well\r\n  understood, that immediately several noblemen and gentlemen
      offered\r\n  themselves as members, and ever since that time its increase has
      been\r\n  so extraordinary, that it consists at present of above 1000 members,\r\n
      \ many of whom are of the greatest quality and fortune: and it can now\r\n  afford
      to offer premiums to the amount of near 2000_l._ _per annum_.\r\n\r\n  The officers
      of this Society are a President, eight Vice-presidents, a\r\n  Register, and
      a Secretary; and these are to be chosen by ballot\r\n  annually on the first
      Tuesday in March. Every person desiring to be a\r\n  member of this Society,
      must be proposed by some member of the same at\r\n  one of their meetings, by
      delivering in the name, addition, and place\r\n  of abode of such person, signed
      by himself; which must be read by the\r\n  Secretary, and balloted for at the
      next meeting, and if two thirds of\r\n  the members then present are for admitting
      such person, he shall be\r\n  deemed a perpetual member on payment of twenty
      guineas, or a\r\n  subscribing member on payment of any sum not less than two
      guineas,\r\n  and continuing such payment annually: but tho\u2019 two guineas
      a year is\r\n  the most common subscription, all the members that are noblemen,
      and\r\n  even some gentlemen, subscribe five guineas, and several others four\r\n
      \ or three. There are also ladies that are subscribers; eminent\r\n  foreigners
      are likewise admitted to be honorary members. At first they\r\n  had a Treasurer,
      but now their money is placed in the Bank of England,\r\n  in the names of the
      President and Vice-presidents, three whereof are\r\n  impowered to draw any
      sum the Society shall order to be paid. And the\r\n  accounts of the receipts
      and payments are constantly examined and\r\n  balanced on the last day of every
      month, by a committee appointed for\r\n  that purpose. Their proceedings are
      regulated by a body of rules and\r\n  orders established by the whole Society,
      and printed for the use of\r\n  the members. All questions and debates are determined
      by holding up of\r\n  hands, or by ballot if required, and no matter can be
      confirmed\r\n  without the assent of a majority at two meetings. They invite
      all the\r\n  world to propose subjects for encouragement, and whatever is deemed\r\n
      \ deserving attention is referred to the consideration of a committee,\r\n  which
      after due enquiry and deliberation make their report to the\r\n  whole Society,
      where it is approved, rejected or altered. A list is\r\n  printed and published
      every year, of the matters for which they\r\n  propose to give premiums, which
      premiums are either sums of money, and\r\n  those sometimes very considerable
      ones, or the Society\u2019s medal in gold\r\n  or silver[1], which they consider
      as the greatest honour they can\r\n  bestow. All possible care is taken to prevent
      partiality in the\r\n  distribution of their premiums, by desiring the claimants
      names may be\r\n  concealed, and by appointing committees, (who when they find
      occasion\r\n  call to their assistance the most skilful artists) for the strict\r\n
      \ examination of the real merit of all matters and things brought before\r\n
      \ them, in consequence of their premiums.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n    The
      weight of the Society\u2019s medal in gold is about six guineas, and\r\n    proportionably
      in silver. On one side Minerva, as Goddess of Wisdom,\r\n    is represented
      introducing Mercury with a purse in his hand, as the\r\n    God of commercial
      arts, to Britannia sitting on a globe: the\r\n    inscription in the Circle,

      by Mr. Pingo, and is thought\r\n    to be well done.\r\n\r\n  The Society\u2019s
      office is opposite to Beaufort Buildings in the Strand:\r\n  their meetings
      are every Wednesday evening at six o\u2019clock, from the\r\n  second Wednesday
      in November to the last Wednesday in May, and at\r\n  other times on the first
      and third Wednesday of every month. They are\r\n  exceedingly well attended,
      and \u2019tis pleasing to behold with how\r\n  laudable a zeal every one endeavours
      to promote the public good, by\r\n  encouraging whatever may improve the arts
      and manufactures, or\r\n  increase the commerce of this kingdom and its colonies.
      They are not\r\n  incorporated, nor seem much to want a charter, as their business
      can\r\n  be carried on very well without one, and the expence would be too\r\n
      \ considerable; but it is hoped their generous disinterested intentions,\r\n
      \ and their extensive views to promote the trade, the riches and honour\r\n
      \ of their country, will in time recommend them to partake the royal\r\n  bounty,
      and that they will long continue to prove themselves to be,\r\n  what they are
      at present, as respectable and useful a society as ever\r\n  was established
      in any nation.\r\n\r\nARUNDEL _stairs_, Arundel street.\u2020\r\n\r\nARUNDEL

      who erected a noble edifice\r\n  in this place, which he enclosed with a park.
      This afterwards became\r\n  the estate and seat of Mr. Fielding, uncle to the

      and endowing it, in order\r\n  to afford lodging and board for twenty poor men
      of that company, and\r\n  for as many boys to be instructed in reading, writing,
      and arithmetic.\r\n  Each of the pensioners hath an apartment consisting of
      three neat\r\n  rooms, with proper diet at a common table, and firing; the annual
      sum\r\n  of 3_l._ and a gown every second year: which, together with the\r\n
      \ salaries of the chaplain, clerk, butler, porter, and other domestics,\r\n
      \ amount to about 800_l._ _per annum_.\r\n\r\n  A plan of the building was drawn
      by Dr. Hook, a learned mathematician\r\n  of Gresham College, and upon his model
      it was erected in an\r\n  advantageous situation, fronting the east, with grass
      plats before it,\r\n  adorned with rows of lime trees, and inclosed with a handsome
      wall and\r\n  iron gates. On the piers of the great gates at the south end,
      are two\r\n  stone statues, representing two of Aske\u2019s Hospital men, in
      full\r\n  proportion. The principal part of the building is only one story high\r\n
      \ with garrets; where a portico with twenty-one stone pillars extends on\r\n
      \ a line on each side of the chapel, which is placed in the middle, and\r\n
      \ on each side above these pillars is a range of twenty-two very small\r\n  windows.
      The pillars of the chapel extend to the top of the first\r\n  story, and that
      edifice rising considerably above the rest of the\r\n  building, is terminated
      by a handsome pediment; with a clock, under\r\n  which is the effigies of the
      founder in stone, cloathed in his gown,\r\n  and holding in his hand a roll

      HOSPITAL, the\r\n  reader will find a noble foundation formed for the reception
      of those\r\n  unhappy women, who have been abandoned to vice; but wisely repenting\r\n
      \ of their folly, resolve to reform. This charitable foundation of which\r\n
      \ we are now going to give a description, was founded at the same time,\r\n
      \ in order to preserve poor friendless and deserted girls, from the\r\n  miseries
      and dangers to which they would be exposed, and from the\r\n  guilt of prostitution.\r\n\r\n
      \ The evils this charity is intended to prevent, are not chimerical, but\r\n
      \ founded on facts. It too often happens, that by the death of the\r\n  father,
      a mother intitled to no relief from any parish, is left with\r\n  several helpless
      children, to be supplied from her industry; her\r\n  resource for subsistence
      is usually to some low occupation, scarcely\r\n  sufficient to afford bread
      and cloathing, and rarely the means of\r\n  instruction. What then must become
      of the daughters of such parents,\r\n  poor and illiterate as they are, and
      thereby exposed to every\r\n  temptation? Necessity may make them prostitutes,
      even before their\r\n  passions can have any share in their guilt. Among these
      unhappy\r\n  objects, very agreeable features are frequently seen disguised
      amidst\r\n  dirt and rags, and this still exposes them to greater hazards; for\r\n
      \ these are the girls which the vile procuress seeks after; she trepans\r\n
      \ them to her brothel, even while they are yet children, and she cleans\r\n
      \ and dresses them up for prostitution. But what is still more dreadful,\r\n
      \ maternal duty and affection have been so thoroughly obliterated, that\r\n
      \ even mothers themselves have been the seducers: they have insnared\r\n  their
      children to the house of the procuress, and shared with her the\r\n  infamous
      gain of initiating their daughters in lewdness: or if this\r\n  has not been
      the case, they have too often been prevailed on, for a\r\n  trifling consideration,
      to conceal and forgive the crime of the\r\n  infamous bawd.\r\n\r\n  These and
      other considerations induced a number of Noblemen and\r\n  Gentlemen, who had
      approved of a proposal from John Fielding, Esq; one\r\n  of the Justices for
      the Liberties of Westminster, to hold their first\r\n  meeting on the 10th of
      May 1758, for carrying into execution a plan of\r\n  this Asylum. Several other
      meetings were soon after held, in which the\r\n  rules and orders for the reception
      and management of the children were\r\n  established, and the lease of a house,
      lately the Hercules Inn near\r\n  Westminster-bridge, agreed for. This house
      was soon fitted up, and\r\n  furnished, and the first children admitted on the
      5th of July\r\n  following.\r\n\r\n  The rules and orders established are as
      follows:\r\n\r\n  I. The qualification of a perpetual Guardian is a benefaction
      of\r\n  thirty guineas or upwards, at one payment.\r\n\r\n  II. That of an annual
      Guardian is a subscription of three guineas or\r\n  upwards per annum.\r\n\r\n
      \ III. Ladies subscribing the said sums, will be considered as Guardians\r\n
      \ of this charity, and have a right of voting at all general elections,\r\n
      \ by proxy, such proxy being a Guardian, or they may send a letter to\r\n  the
      board, naming therein the person they vote for, which shall be\r\n  considered
      as their vote. It is esteemed by the Guardians a benefit to\r\n  the charity,
      for the Ladies occasionally to visit the house, and\r\n  inspect the management
      of the children; the matron being ordered to\r\n  attend such Ladies, and to
      give them all necessary information: and,\r\n  whatever observations they may
      then make, or whatever hints, at other\r\n  times, may occur to them, for the
      good of the charity, if they will be\r\n  pleased to transmit them by letter
      to the Secretary, or to the\r\n  Committee, who meet every Wednesday in the
      forenoon at the Asylum,\r\n  they will be immediately taken into consideration,
      and have all\r\n  respectful regard shewn to them.\r\n\r\n  IV. Those Gentlemen
      and Ladies, who have already subscribed lesser\r\n  sums than thirty guineas,
      by making up their subscriptions to that\r\n  sum, within a year, will be entered
      in the subscription book as\r\n  perpetual Guardians.\r\n\r\n  V. There is to
      be an annual general meeting of the Guardians on the\r\n  second Wednesday in
      March.\r\n\r\n  VI. A general quarterly meeting is to be held on the second
      Wednesday\r\n  in July, the second Wednesday in January, the second Wednesday
      in\r\n  April, and the second Wednesday in October, for auditing the accounts,\r\n
      \ and making laws and rules for the government of the charity, and for\r\n  other
      business.\r\n\r\n  VII. A Committee is appointed, to consist of thirty Guardians,
      who are\r\n  to meet every Wednesday at eleven o\u2019clock in the forenoon
      at the\r\n  Asylum, to transact the business of the charity; and they are, from\r\n
      \ time to time, to report their proceedings to the following general\r\n  court,
      and any three of the said gentlemen constitute a quorum. In\r\n  these Committees
      are a President, Vice-president, and a Treasurer.\r\n\r\n  VIII. The officers
      and servants of the house, are a Physician, two\r\n  Surgeons, an Apothecary
      and a Chaplain.\r\n\r\n  A Secretary, who keeps the accounts of the hospital,
      and does all such\r\n  other business as is commonly done by Secretaries, Clerks,
      and\r\n  Registers, at other charities.\r\n\r\n  A Matron, who superintends
      the affairs of the house, takes care of the\r\n  provisions and furniture, delivers
      an account of the current expences\r\n  weekly to the Secretary, to be laid
      before the Committee. She is to\r\n  see that the children are properly employed,
      that they are attentive\r\n  to their learning, and that they behave with decency;
      that the\r\n  teachers do their duty, and that they treat the children with\r\n
      \ humanity. The servants under her, are teachers of reading, knitting,\r\n  sewing,
      &c. a cook, a house-maid, and a servant man.\r\n\r\n  IX. The objects to be
      admitted are Orphans, the daughters of\r\n  necessitous parents, residing in
      parishes where they have no relief,\r\n  and deserted girls within the bills
      of mortality, from eight to twelve\r\n  years of age; but infirm children are
      not admitted, as the objects of\r\n  this charity are to be constantly employed
      in every branch of good\r\n  housewifry.\r\n\r\n  X. Each object applying for
      admission, must produce such certificate\r\n  of her age and necessity, as shall
      be satisfactory to the Guardians\r\n  then present; and in all cases, wherein,
      during the infancy of this\r\n  Asylum, more objects shall apply for admission
      than the Asylum can at\r\n  once receive, the names of the objects not admitted
      are entered in a\r\n  book kept for that purpose, and a notice is sent to the
      persons,\r\n  signifying the certificate of each child, of the first opportunity
      of\r\n  taking in such children that shall happen afterwards; in filling up\r\n
      \ all which, the children, before refused, have the preference as they\r\n  stand
      upon the entry: each of the above certificates must be signed by\r\n  two substantial
      housekeepers, of the parish where the object resides.\r\n\r\n  XI. The children
      are regularly and alternately employed in reading,\r\n  knitting, sewing, and
      in the business of the kitchen, to which latter\r\n  employment four are appointed
      weekly, to be with the cook, to assist\r\n  her, and to receive from her the
      necessary instructions in plain\r\n  cookery, curing provisions, and other employments
      of the kitchen. They\r\n  likewise make the beds, clean the rooms, assist in
      washing, and\r\n  ironing the linen, and in other household business, according
      to their\r\n  respective ages and abilities, at the discretion of the matron.\r\n\r\n
      \ XII. The Chaplain on Sundays preaches, and performs the other parts of\r\n
      \ divine service, and catechises the children. Prayers also are read on\r\n
      \ the other days of the week, by the matron or teacher; and some portion\r\n
      \ of scripture is read by those of the children who are best able. They\r\n
      \ have also, each of them, a common prayer book, and the new testament;\r\n
      \ and other good books are likewise provided for them.\r\n\r\n  The number of
      children in the house in April 1759, were forty-two, and\r\n  the sums raised
      for the support of this charitable foundation, at the\r\n  same time, amounted
      to 2032_l._ 4_s._ 9_d._\r\n\r\nAUDLEY\u2019S _rents_, Whitecross street.\u2020\r\n\r\nAUDLEY

      of the\r\n  Universities, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London, and the Mayors

      proper.\r\n\r\n  The business of the Governors is to find out the value of every\r\n
      \ benefice under 80_l._ a Year, with the distance of each from London,\r\n  &c.
      and to lay the state thereof before his Majesty, with the value of\r\n  the
      tenths, first-fruits, &c. in order that the royal bounty may be\r\n  applied
      to support those of the clergy, who are in the greatest\r\n  distress: and this
      corporation has actually augmented a great number\r\n  of small livings.\r\n\r\nAUSTIN
      FRIARS, near Broad street, was a priory founded for the Friars\r\n  Eremites,
      of the order of St. Augustine, in the year 1253, by Humphrey\r\n  Bohun, Earl
      of Hereford and Essex, The Friars of this priory were\r\n  Mendicants, and continued
      in the possession of this place till its\r\n  dissolution by King Henry VIII.
      since which time the greatest part has\r\n  been pulled down, and many handsome
      houses built; but a part of the\r\n  old church belonging to the priory is still
      standing. King Edward VI.\r\n  granted all the church, except the choir, to
      a congregation of\r\n  Germans, and other strangers, who fled hither for the
      sake of\r\n  religion, ordering it to be called _the Temple of the Lord Jesus_,
      and\r\n  several successive Princes have confirmed it to the Dutch, by whom
      it\r\n  is still used as a place of divine worship. It is a large and spacious\r\n
      \ Gothic edifice, supported by two rows of stone pillars. At the east\r\n  end
      are several steps, which lead to a large platform, on which is\r\n  placed a
      long table with seats against the wall, and forms round, for\r\n  the use of
      the Holy Communion, and the windows on one side have\r\n  painted on them in
      several places, the words JESUS TEMPLE. On the west\r\n  end over the screen
      is a library, thus inscribed, _Ecclesi\xE6\r\n  Londino-Belgic\xE6 Bibliotheca,
      extructa sumptibus_ Mari\xE6 Dubois 1659. It\r\n  contains several valuable
      manuscripts, among which are the letters of\r\n  Calvin, Peter Martyr, and other
      foreign reformers.\r\n\r\n_St._ AUSTIN\u2019S _Church_, at the north west corner
      of Watling street, in\r\n  the ward of Faringdon within, was dedicated to St.
      Austin the monk,\r\n  the English Apostle. The old church having suffered in
      the dreadful\r\n  conflagration in 1666, has been rebuilt, and the parish of
      St. Faith\r\n  united to it. It is a rectory, and the advowson is in the Dean
      and\r\n  Chapter of St. Paul\u2019s. The Rector receives 172_l._ _per annum_
      in lieu\r\n  of tithes.\r\n\r\nAUSTIN _street_, in Castle street, near Shoreditch.\r\n\r\nAX

      at Mile End, were\r\n  erected by the Drapers company in the year 1735, pursuant
      to the will\r\n  of Mr. Francis Bancroft, who bequeathed to that company the
      sum of\r\n  28,000_l._ and upwards, in real and personal estates, for purchasing
      a\r\n  site, and building upon it an almshouse, with convenient apartments\r\n
      \ for twenty-four almsmen, a chapel, and school room for 100 poor boys,\r\n
      \ and two dwelling-houses for the schoolmasters, and endowing the same.\r\n
      \ He also ordered that each of the almsmen should have 8_l._ and half a\r\n
      \ chaldron of coals yearly, and a gown of baize every third year; that\r\n  the
      school boys should be cloathed and taught reading, writing and\r\n  arithmetic;
      that each of the masters, besides their houses, should\r\n  have a salary of
      30_l._ _per annum_, and the yearly sum of 20_l._ for\r\n  coals and candles,
      for their use, and that of the school; with a\r\n  sufficient allowance for
      books, paper, pens and ink; that the\r\n  committee of the court of assistants
      should have 5_l._ for a dinner,\r\n  at their annual visitation of the almshouse
      and school; and that 3_l._\r\n  10_s._ should be given for two half yearly sermons
      to be preached in\r\n  the parish churches of St. Helen and St. Michael Cornhill,
      or\r\n  elsewhere, in commemoration of this foundation, at which the almsmen\r\n
      \ and boys were to be present. To each of these boys, when put out\r\n  apprentices,
      he gave 4_l._ but if they were put to service they were\r\n  to have no more
      than 2_l._ 10_s._ to buy them cloaths.\r\n\r\n  The edifice is not only neat
      but extremely elegant, consisting of two\r\n  wings and a center detached from
      both of them. In the middle of the\r\n  front is the chapel, before which is
      a noble portico, with Ionic\r\n  columns, and coupled pilasters at the corners,
      supporting a pediment,\r\n  in the plane of which is the dial. There is an ascent
      to the portico\r\n  by a flight of steps, and over the chapel is a handsome
      turret. On\r\n  each side of the portico, are two houses like those in the wings.
      The\r\n  construction of the wings is uniform, lofty and convenient: twelve\r\n
      \ doors in each open in a regular series, and the windows are of a\r\n  moderate
      size, numerous, and proportioned to the apartments they are\r\n  to enlighten.
      The square is surrounded with gravel walks. with a large\r\n  grass plat in
      the middle, and next the road the wall is adorned with\r\n  handsome iron rails
      and gates. In short, the ends of the wings next\r\n  the road being placed at
      a considerable distance from it, the whole is\r\n  seen in a proper point of
      view, and appears to the greatest advantage.\r\n\r\n  It is worthy of remark,
      that this Bancroft, who left so large a sum\r\n  for erecting and endowing this
      fine hospital, and even ordered two\r\n  sermons to be annually preached in
      commemoration of his charity, was,\r\n  according to the last edition of _Stow\u2019s
      Survey_, one of the Lord\r\n  Mayor\u2019s officers, and by informations and
      summoning the citizens\r\n  before the Lord Mayor, upon the most trifling occasions,
      and other\r\n  things not belonging to his office, not only pillaged the poor
      but\r\n  also many of the rich, who rather than lose time in appearing before\r\n
      \ that Magistrate, gave money to get rid of this common pest of the\r\n  citizens,
      which, together with his numerous quarterages from the\r\n  brokers, &c. enabled
      him to amass annually a considerable sum of\r\n  money. But by these and other
      mercenary practices, he so incurred the\r\n  hatred and ill-will of the citizens
      of all ranks and denominations,\r\n  that the persons who attended his funeral
      obsequies, with great\r\n  difficulty saved his corpse from being jostled off
      the bearers\r\n  shoulders in the church, by the enraged populace, who seizing
      the\r\n  bells, rang them for joy at his unlamented death.\r\n\r\nBANDYLEG _alley_,

      OF ENGLAND. This is a noble edifice, situated at the east of St.\r\n  Christopher\u2019s
      church, near the west end of Threadneedle street. The\r\n  front next the street
      is about 80 feet in length, and is of the Ionic\r\n  order raised on a rustic
      basement, as is represented in the print, and\r\n  is in a good style. Through
      this you pass into the court yard, in\r\n  which is the hall. This is of the
      Corinthian order, and in the middle\r\n  is a pediment. The top of the building
      is adorned with a balustrade\r\n  and handsome vases, and in the face of the
      above pediment is engraved,\r\n  in relievo, the Company\u2019s seal, Britannia
      sitting with her shield and\r\n  spear, and at her feet a Cornucopia, pouring
      out fruit. The hall,\r\n  which is in this last building, is 79 feet in length,
      and 40 in\r\n  breadth; it is wainscoted about eight feet high; has a fine fretwork\r\n
      \ ceiling, and is adorned with the statue of King William III. which\r\n  stands

      \                        Has erected this Statue,\r\n                     And
      dedicated it to his Memory,\r\n                    In the Year of our Lord MDCCXXXIV.\r\n
      \                  And the first Year of this Building.\r\n\r\n  Farther backward
      is another quadrangle, with an arcade on the east and\r\n  west sides of it;
      and on the north side is the accomptant\u2019s office,\r\n  which is 60 feet
      long, and 28 feet broad. Over this, and the other\r\n  sides of the quadrangle,
      are handsome apartments, with a fine\r\n  staircase adorned with fretwork, and
      under it are large vaults, that\r\n  have strong walls and iron gates, for the
      preservation of the cash.\r\n  The back entrance from Bartholomew lane is by
      a grand gateway, which\r\n  opens into a commodious and spacious court yard
      for coaches, or\r\n  waggons, that frequently come loaded with gold and silver
      bullion; and\r\n  in the room fronting the gate the transfer office is kept.\r\n\r\n
      \ The Bank was established by act of Parliament in the year 1693, under\r\n
      \ the title of _The Governor and Company of the Bank of England_, in\r\n  consideration
      of a loan of 1,200,000_l._ granted to the government,\r\n  for which the subscribers
      received eight _per cent._ By this charter,\r\n  the Company are not to borrow
      under their common seal, unless by act\r\n  of parliament; they are not to trade,
      or suffer any person in trust\r\n  for them to trade in goods or merchandize;
      but may deal in bills of\r\n  exchange, in buying or selling bullion, and foreign
      gold, or silver\r\n  coin, &c.\r\n\r\n  By an act passed in the 8th and 9th
      years of the reign of King William\r\n  III. they were empowered to enlarge
      their capital to 2,201,171_l._\r\n  10_s._ It was then also enacted, that bank
      stock should be a personal\r\n  and not a real estate; that no contract, either
      in word or writing,\r\n  for buying or selling bank stock, should be good in
      law, unless\r\n  registered in the books of the bank within seven days, and
      the stock\r\n  transferred within fourteen days; and that it should be felony,\r\n
      \ without benefit of clergy, to counterfeit the common seal of the Bank,\r\n
      \ any sealed bank bill, any bank note, or to alter or erase such bills\r\n  or
      notes.\r\n\r\n  In the 7th of Queen Anne, the Company were, by another act,
      impowered\r\n  to increase their capital to 4,402,343_l._ and at the same time
      they\r\n  advanced 400,000_l._ more to the government; and in 1714, they\r\n
      \ advanced the sum of 1,500,000_l._\r\n\r\n  In the third year of the reign
      of King George I. the interest of their\r\n  capital was reduced to 5_l._ _per
      cent._ when the Bank agreed to\r\n  deliver up as many Exchequer bills as amounted
      to two millions, and to\r\n  accept of an annuity of 100,000_l._ _per annum_.
      It was also declared\r\n  lawful for the Bank to call for from their members,
      in proportion to\r\n  their interests in the capital stock, such sums, as in
      a general court\r\n  should be found necessary; but if any member should neglect
      to pay his\r\n  share of the money so called for, at the time appointed, by
      notice in\r\n  the London Gazette and fixed up in the Royal Exchange, it should
      be\r\n  lawful for the Bank, not only to stop the dividend of such member, and\r\n
      \ to apply it towards the payment of the money so called for, but also\r\n  to
      stop the transfers of such defaulter, and to charge him with an\r\n  interest
      of 5_l._ _per cent._ _per annum_, for the money so omitted to\r\n  be paid;
      and if the principal and interest should be three months\r\n  unpaid, the Bank
      should have power to sell so much of the stock\r\n  belonging to the defaulter
      as would satisfy the same. This stock is\r\n  now called Bank Circulation, every
      proprietor of which receives 5_l._\r\n  _per cent._ _per annum_, but is obliged
      to advance, if called for,\r\n  1000_l._ for every 100_l._ so paid in.\r\n\r\n
      \ The Bank afterwards consented to have the interest of two millions\r\n  still
      due from the government, reduced from 5 to 4 _per cent._ The\r\n  Company also
      purchased several other annuities, that were afterwards\r\n  redeemed by the
      government, and the national debt due to the Bank was\r\n  reduced to 1,600,000.\r\n\r\n
      \ At length in 1742, the Company agreed to supply the government with\r\n  1,600,000_l._
      at 3_l._ _per cent._, by which means the government\r\n  became indebted to
      the Company 3,200,000_l._ the one half carrying 4,\r\n  and the other 3 _per
      cent._\r\n\r\n  In 1746, the Company consented that the sum of 986,800_l._ due
      to them\r\n  in Exchequer bills unsatisfied, on the duties for licences to sell\r\n
      \ spirituous liquors by retail, should be cancelled, and in lieu thereof\r\n
      \ to accept of an annuity of 39,442_l._ the interest of that sum at\r\n  4_l._
      _per cent._ The Company also agreed to advance the farther sum\r\n  of 1,000,000_l._
      upon the credit of the duties arising by the malt and\r\n  land tax, at 4_l._
      _per cent._ for Exchequer bills to be issued for\r\n  that purpose, in consideration
      of which the Company were enabled to\r\n  augment their capital with 986,800_l._
      the interest of which, as well\r\n  as that of the other annuities, was reduced
      to 3_l._ 10_s._ _per\r\n  cent._ till the 25th of December 1757, and from that
      time they carry\r\n  only 3_l._ _per cent._\r\n\r\n  In short, several other
      sums have since been raised by the Bank for\r\n  the service of the government:
      but the above is sufficient to give a\r\n  full idea of the nature of the several
      species of annuities; only it\r\n  may be proper to add, that what is called
      Bank Stock is entirely\r\n  distinct from these, and may not improperly be termed,
      the trading\r\n  stock of the Company, since with this they discount bills,
      and deal\r\n  very largely in foreign gold, &c. which they only buy by weight,
      which\r\n  trade is so very considerable, as to render a share in this stock
      very\r\n  valuable, tho\u2019 it is not equal in value to the East India stock.
      The\r\n  Company make dividends of the profits half yearly. _Pocket Library._\r\n\r\n

      \ [Illustration: _S. Wales delin._ _J. Green sc. Oxon._ _Banqueting\r\n  House._]\r\n\r\n\r\nBANQUETING
      HOUSE, Whitehall, so called from there being originally in\r\n  this place an
      edifice in which our Kings had public entertainments.\r\n  This was a small
      part of the ancient palace of Whitehall, which was\r\n  destroyed by fire in
      1697, and only the Banqueting House, and one\r\n  court left standing. See the
      article WHITEHALL.\r\n\r\n  In the reign of King James I. the Banqueting House
      being in a ruinous\r\n  condition, that Monarch formed the design of erecting
      a palace on the\r\n  spot, worthy the residence of the Kings of England. The
      celebrated\r\n  Inigo Jones was employed to draw the plan of a noble edifice;
      this was\r\n  done, and the present structure erected, as a small part of the
      great\r\n  intended work, for the reception of ambassadors, and other audiences\r\n
      \ of state. The engraved view of it, which is here given, will best\r\n  illustrate
      what follows.\r\n\r\n  This is a regular and august building which has three
      stories. The\r\n  lowest has a rustic wall, with small square windows, and by
      its\r\n  strength happily serves for a basis for the orders. Upon this is\r\n
      \ raised the Ionic, with columns and pilasters, and between the columns\r\n
      \ are well-proportioned windows, with arched and pointed pediments. Over\r\n
      \ these is placed the proper entablature, and on this is raised a second\r\n
      \ series of the Corinthian order, consisting of columns and pilasters\r\n  like
      the other; column being placed over column, and pilaster over\r\n  pilaster.
      From the capitals are carried festoons, which meet with\r\n  masks and other
      ornaments in the middle. This series is also crowned\r\n  with its proper entablature,
      on which is raised the balustrade with\r\n  Attic pedestals between, which crown
      the work. Every thing in this\r\n  building is finely proportioned, and as happily
      executed. The\r\n  projection of the columns from the wall has a fine effect
      in the\r\n  entablatures, which being brought forward in the same proportion,\r\n
      \ gives that happy diversity of light and shade so essential to fine\r\n  architecture.
      _English Architecture._\r\n\r\n  To render this edifice as perfect as possible,
      the ceiling is finely\r\n  painted by the celebrated Sir Peter Paul Rubens,
      who was ambassador\r\n  here in the time of Charles I. The subject is the entrance,\r\n
      \ inauguration, and coronation of King James I. represented by Pagan\r\n  emblems.
      It is esteemed one of his most capital performances, and may\r\n  be justly
      esteemed one of the finest ceilings in the world. This great\r\n  apartment
      is at present converted into a chapel, for the service of\r\n  which certain
      select preachers were appointed out of each university,\r\n  by King George
      I. to preach here every Sunday; for this each are\r\n  allowed a stipend of
      30_l._ a year.\r\n\r\nBANSTED, a village in Surrey, situated between Dorking
      and Croydon,\r\n  famous for producing a great number of walnuts; but much more
      for its\r\n  neighbouring Downs, one of the most delightful spots in England,
      on\r\n  account of the agreeable seats in that neighbourhood; for the\r\n  extensive
      prospect of several counties on both sides the Thames, and\r\n  even of the
      royal palaces of Windsor and Hampton Court; and for the\r\n  fineness of the
      turf, covered with a short grass intermixed with\r\n  thyme, and other fragrant
      herbs, that render the mutton of this tract,\r\n  though small, remarkable for
      its sweetness. In these Downs there is a\r\n  four miles course for horse races,
      which is much frequented.\r\n\r\nBAPTISTS, a sect of dissenters, thus denominated
      from their baptizing by\r\n  immersing the body all over, and from their not
      considering infants as\r\n  proper subjects of baptism. They are principally
      divided into two\r\n  classes, termed general and particular. The general Baptists,
      who with\r\n  Arminius maintain the doctrine of universal redemption, consist
      of\r\n  only six congregations, who have their meeting-houses as follows:\r\n\r\n
      \ 1. Fair street, Horsely down. 2. Glasshouse yard, Pickax street, near\r\n

      \ two different congregations, who maintain their own Minister. 6. Queen\r\n
      \ street, in the Park, Southwark.\r\n\r\n  The particular Baptists, who with
      Calvin believe that none will be\r\n  saved but the elect, and that all the
      rest of mankind are doomed to\r\n  eternal misery, are much more numerous, and
      have the following\r\n  meetings.\r\n\r\n  1. Angel alley, Whitechapel. 2. Artillery

      The art of surgery was anciently practised in this city by none\r\n  but the
      Barbers, who were incorporated by letters patent granted by\r\n  King Edward
      IV. in the Year 1461, and in 1512 an act was passed to\r\n  prevent any persons
      besides the Barbers practising surgery within the\r\n  city of London, and seven
      miles round. At length several persons, who\r\n  were not Barbers, being examined
      and admitted as practitioners in the\r\n  art of surgery, the parliament united
      them in the thirty-second year\r\n  of the reign of King Henry VIII. by the
      appellation of _the Masters or\r\n  Governors of the mystery or commonalty of
      Barbers and Surgeons of the\r\n  city of London_; and by this act all persons
      practising the art of\r\n  shaving, are strictly enjoined not to intermeddle
      with that of\r\n  surgery, except what belongs to drawing of teeth. Thus this
      company\r\n  obtained the name of Barber-Surgeons, which they continued to enjoy\r\n
      \ till the eighteenth year of the reign of his present Majesty King\r\n  George
      II. when the Surgeons applying to Parliament to have this union\r\n  dissolved,
      were formed into a separate company; though the Barbers\r\n  were left in possession
      of the hall and theatre, and were constituted\r\n  a body politic, under the
      name of _the Master, Governors and\r\n  Commonalty of the mystery of Barbers
      of London_.\r\n\r\n  This company has a Master and three other Governors, a
      court of\r\n  Assistants of twenty-four members, and a very numerous livery.\r\n\r\nBARBERS
      HALL, a fine edifice on the west side of Monkwell street,\r\n  consisting of
      a spacious hall room, a court room, theatre, library,\r\n  and other commodious
      offices. The grand entrance from Monkwell street\r\n  is enriched with the company\u2019s
      arms, large fruit, and other\r\n  decorations. The court room has a fretwork
      ceiling, and is also\r\n  adorned with the pictures of King Henry VIII. and
      the court of\r\n  Assistants, in one fine piece; a portrait of King Charles
      II. and\r\n  other paintings. The theatre contains four degrees of cedar seats,
      one\r\n  above another, in an elliptical form, and the roof is an elliptical\r\n
      \ cupola; this room is adorned with a bust of King Charles I. the\r\n  figures
      of the seven liberal sciences, and the twelve signs of the\r\n  Zodiac; the
      skins of a man and woman on wooden frames, in imitation of\r\n  Adam and Eve;
      the figure of a man flayed, done after the life, all the\r\n  muscles appearing
      in their due place, and proportion; the skeleton of\r\n  an ostrich; an human
      skeleton, with copper joints, and five other\r\n  skeletons of human bodies.
      But as this furniture was introduced by the\r\n  Surgeons, it is now of no use,
      and the theatre is entirely deserted.\r\n\r\n  This Hall is one of the works
      of that great architect Inigo Jones, and\r\n  is a masterpiece in its kind,
      that elegant simplicity which\r\n  characterises all his works, giving the spectator
      the highest\r\n  satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBARBER\u2019S _alley_, Brown\u2019s lane,

      being chiefly inhabited by fishermen. The\r\n  parish has been so much enlarged
      by lands recovered from the Thames,\r\n  and the river Rothing, which runs on
      the west side of the town, that\r\n  it has two chapels of ease, one at Ilford,
      and another called New\r\n  chapel, on the side of Epping forest, and the great
      and small tithes\r\n  are computed at above 600_l._ _per annum_. At a small

      Mortlake and Barn Elms, and is seven miles from London, and\r\n  five from Kingston.\r\n\r\nBARNET,
      a market town in Hertfordshire, situated in the road to St.\r\n  Alban\u2019s,
      eleven miles from London, on the top of a hill, whence it is\r\n  called High
      Barnet, and also Chipping, or Cheaping Barnet, from King\r\n  Henry the Second\u2019s
      granting the monks of St. Alban\u2019s the privilege of\r\n  holding a market
      here; the word Cheap, or Chepe, being an ancient word\r\n  for a market. As
      this place is a great thoroughfare, it is well\r\n  supplied with inns. The
      church is a chapel of ease to the village of\r\n  East Barnet. Here is a free
      school founded by Q. Elizabeth, and\r\n  endowed partly by that Princess, and
      partly by Alderman Owen, of\r\n  London, whose additional endowment is paid
      by the Fishmongers company,\r\n  who appoint 24 governors, by whom the master
      and usher are chosen to\r\n  teach seven children gratis, and all the other
      children of the parish\r\n  for 5_s_ a quarter. Here is also an almshouse founded
      and endowed by\r\n  James Ravenscroft, Esq; for six widows.\r\n\r\n  This place
      is remarkable for the decisive battle fought there between\r\n  the houses of
      York and Lancaster, on Easter day, 1468, in which the\r\n  great Earl of Warwick,
      stiled _the Setter up, and Puller down of\r\n  Kings_, was slain, with many
      others of the principal nobility. The\r\n  place supposed to be the field of
      battle, is a green spot, a little\r\n  before the meeting of the St. Alban\u2019s
      and Hatfield roads: and here, in\r\n  the year 1740, a stone column was erected,
      on which is inscribed a\r\n  long account of that battle.\r\n\r\nBARNET (EAST)
      a pleasant village in Hertfordshire, near Whetstone and\r\n  Enfield Chace,
      formerly much frequented on account of its medicinal\r\n  spring, which was
      discovered in a neighbouring common about an hundred\r\n  years ago. The church
      is a mean edifice; but the rectory is very\r\n  beneficial.\r\n\r\n  Here is

      _Church_, situated at the south east corner of\r\n  Bartholomew lane, behind
      the Royal Exchange, was one of the churches\r\n  consumed in the general conflagration
      in 1666, and this structure\r\n  arose in its place. It consists of a very irregular
      body, with a tower\r\n  suited to it, the top of which, instead of pinnacles,
      a spire, or\r\n  turrets, is crowned with arches, supported by columns of the\r\n
      \ Corinthian order. It is a rectory, in the gift of the Crown, and the\r\n  Rector
      receives 100_l._ a year in lieu of tithes.\r\n\r\nBARTHOLOMEW _lane_, extends
      from Threadneedle street to Lothbury, and is\r\n  so named from St. Bartholomew\u2019s
      church at the corner.\r\n\r\n_St._ BARTHOLOMEW _the Great_, situated near the
      east end of Duck lane,\r\n  on the north east side of Smithfield, escaped the
      flames in 1666, and\r\n  is a large plain church, with a tower crowned with
      a turret. It is a\r\n  rectory in the patronage of the Earl of Holland, The
      Rector\u2019s profits,\r\n  besides casualties, amount to about 60_l._ _per
      annum_.\r\n\r\n_St._ BARTHOLOMEW _the Less_, is seated on the south east side
      of\r\n  Smithfield, adjoining to St. Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital. It was founded
      in\r\n  the year 1102, and belonged to the neighbouring convent of the same\r\n
      \ name; but as it was not destroyed by the fire in 1666, it remains in\r\n  the
      same state it was in before that dreadful calamity. It is a low\r\n  building,
      composed of brick and rough stone plaistered; and consists\r\n  of a roofed
      body with Gothic windows, and a tower with a corner\r\n  turret. This church
      is a vicarage, in the gift of the Lord Mayor,\r\n  Aldermen, and Common Council,
      who upon receiving the grant of the\r\n  church and hospital, covenanted to
      pay the Vicar 13_l._ 6_s._ 8_d._\r\n  _per annum_, which, with an allowance
      from the hospital, and\r\n  casualties, amounts to about 120_l._ _per annum_.\r\n\r\n_St._
      BARTHOLOMEW\u2019S HOSPITAL, on the south east of Smithfield, for the\r\n  cure
      of the poor, sick and lame, formerly belonged to the Priory of\r\n  St. Bartholomew
      in Smithfield; but both the priory and hospital being\r\n  dissolved by K. Henry
      VIII. that Monarch, in the last year of his\r\n  reign, founded the hospital
      anew, and endowed it with the annual\r\n  revenue of 500 marks, upon condition
      that the city should pay the same\r\n  sum, which proposal was readily embraced,
      and the managers of this\r\n  foundation were incorporated by the name of _The
      Hospital of the\r\n  Mayor, Commonalty and Citizens of London, Governors for
      the poor,\r\n  called Little St. Bartholomew\u2019s, near West Smithfield_.
      Since that\r\n  time the hospital has received prodigious benefactions from
      great\r\n  numbers of charitable persons, by which means not only the poor of\r\n
      \ London and Southwark, but the distressed of any other parts of the\r\n  King\u2019s
      dominions, and from foreign countries, are taken in, whether\r\n  sick or maimed,
      and have lodging, food, attendance, and medicines,\r\n  with the advice and
      assistance of some of the best Physicians and\r\n  Surgeons in the kingdom,
      who belong to the hospital, and attend the\r\n  patients as occasion requires;
      they have also matrons and nurses, to\r\n  look after and assist them; and at
      their discharge when cured, some,\r\n  who live at a considerable distance,
      are relieved with money, cloaths,\r\n  and other necessaries, to enable them
      to return to their several\r\n  habitations. Pity it is that so noble and humane
      a foundation should\r\n  want any thing to render it perfect, and that every
      sick person who is\r\n  admitted, except such as have suffered by sudden accidents,
      as the\r\n  fracture or dislocation of a bone, should be obliged to deposit
      or\r\n  give security for the payment of a guinea, in case of death, in order\r\n
      \ to defray the expence of the funeral; for by this some of the poorest\r\n
      \ and most miserable, and consequently the most proper objects, are\r\n  unhappily
      excluded from reaping the benefit they might otherwise\r\n  receive from it:
      but this is also the case of several of the other\r\n  hospitals of this city;
      however many thousands of persons labouring\r\n  under the most dreadful diseases
      and wounds, are annually cured at\r\n  this hospital, and in those of Kent street
      in Southwark, and the Lock\r\n  at Kingsland, both of which are dependent on
      it. Besides all this,\r\n  there are great numbers of out-patients, who receive
      advice and\r\n  medicines gratis.\r\n\r\n  The ancient hospital which escaped
      the fire of London becoming\r\n  ruinous, it was found absolutely necessary
      in the year 1729 to rebuild\r\n  it; a plan for that purpose was formed, and
      a grand edifice erected,\r\n  by subscription, which was designed to be only
      one out of four noble\r\n  detached piles of building, to be afterwards raised,
      about a court or\r\n  area 250 feet in length, and 60 in breadth.\r\n\r\n  The
      original design is now nearly compleated, and this hospital\r\n  altogether
      forms a very elegant building, or rather buildings, for the\r\n  sides which
      compose the quadrangle do not join at the angles, as is\r\n  usual, but by four
      walls, each having a large gate which admits you\r\n  into the area, as may
      be seen in the print. Here is a staircase\r\n  painted and given by Mr. Hogarth,
      containing two pictures with figures\r\n  large as the life, which for truth
      of colouring and expression may vie\r\n  with any thing of its kind in Europe.
      The subject of the one is the\r\n  Good Samaritan, the other the Pool of Bethesda.\r\n\r\nBARTLET\u2019S

      King\u2019s bedchamber, and there\r\n  to lie all night on a pallet bed by the
      King, and to supply the place\r\n  of the Groom of the Stole in his absence.
      They also wait upon the King\r\n  when he eats in private; for the cupbearers,
      carvers, and sewers do\r\n  not then wait. The Groom of the Stole has 2000_l._

      and manor of the ancient family of the\r\n  Carews, is a noble edifice; but
      the wings are too deep for the body of\r\n  the house; for they should either
      have been placed at a greater\r\n  distance, or not have been so long. The court
      before them is fine, as\r\n  is the canal in the park, which lies before this
      court, and has a\r\n  river running through it. All the flat part of the park
      is taken up\r\n  with very fine gardens, which extend in vistas two or three
      miles. The\r\n  orangery is said to be the only one in England that is planted
      in the\r\n  natural ground, and the trees, which are above an hundred years
      old,\r\n  were brought out of Italy by Sir Francis Carew, Bart. They are,\r\n
      \ however, secured in the winter by moveable covers. The pleasure house,\r\n
      \ which was also built by Sir Francis, has the famous Spanish Armada\r\n  painted
      on the top of it, and under it is a cold bath. The church is a\r\n  beautiful
      small Gothic pile, built of stone, in the north and south\r\n  isles of which
      are several stalls after the manner of cathedrals: and\r\n  here is also two

      many miles beyond the Thames, which is about a mile and\r\n  half distant. This
      river and navigation add greatly to the beauty of\r\n  this scene, which exhibits
      to the eye of the delighted spectator, as\r\n  pleasing a landskip of the kind
      as imagination can form. The\r\n  innumerable ships employed in the immense
      trade of London, are beheld\r\n  continually sailing up and down the river.
      On the other side are\r\n  prospects not less beautiful, tho\u2019 of another

      vulgarly called St.\r\n  Bennet, an Italian saint, the founder of the order
      of Benedictine\r\n  monks; and received the additional name of _Fink_ from its
      rebuilder\r\n  Robert Fink. It is situated on the south side of Thread-needle-street.\r\n
      \ The old church being destroyed in the general conflagration in 1666,\r\n  the
      present edifice was erected in its room. The body is of an\r\n  irregular form,
      enlightened by large arched windows, which reach to\r\n  the roof; this is incompassed
      with a balustrade, and crowned with a\r\n  lantern: a dome rises upon the whole
      extent of the tower, and on its\r\n  top rises a turret.\r\n\r\n  This church
      is a curacy in the patronage of the Dean and Chapter of\r\n  Windsor, who generally
      supply it with one of their own Canons. The\r\n  Curate receives 100_l._ a year
      in lieu of tithes.\r\n\r\n_St._ BENNET\u2019S _Gracechurch street_, is situated
      at the south west\r\n  corner of Fenchurch street. The old church being much
      damaged by the\r\n  fire in 1666, was taken down, and the present structure
      erected in its\r\n  place, which is built principally of stone, and is a regular,\r\n
      \ convenient, and neat edifice, without the expence of columns and\r\n  porticos.
      It has a handsome balustrade at the top, and a very high\r\n  spire of the obelisk
      kind, the base of which is supported by four\r\n  porticos.\r\n\r\n  This church
      is a rectory in the patronage of the Dean and Chapter of\r\n  St. Paul\u2019s;
      and the parish of St. Leonard Eastcheap is annexed to it.\r\n  The Rector receives
      140_l._ a year in lieu of tithes.\r\n\r\n_St._ BENNET\u2019S _Paul\u2019s Wharf_,
      is so called from its being consecrated\r\n  to St. Benedict, and its vicinity
      to that wharf. It is situated at the\r\n  south west corner of St. Bennet\u2019s
      hill, and the old church being\r\n  destroyed by the fire of London in 1666,
      this was erected in its\r\n  place, from a design of Sir Christopher Wren. It
      is a neat structure;\r\n  the body is well proportioned: the tower has rustic
      corners, and its\r\n  turret and small spire are raised from the crown of a
      dome.\r\n\r\n  This church is a rectory, the collation to which is in the Dean
      and\r\n  Chapter of St. Paul\u2019s. The parish of St. Peter Paul\u2019s Wharf
      is united\r\n  to it, and the Rector receives 100_l._ a year in lieu of tithes.\r\n\r\n
      \ _St_. BENNET\u2019S _Sherehog_, stood opposite to St. Sythe\u2019s lane, in
      St.\r\n  Pancras lane, and in the ward of Cheap. In the year 1323, it went by\r\n
      \ the name of St. Osyth, from its being dedicated to a queen and martyr\r\n
      \ of that name; but she was divested of the tutelage of this church, by\r\n
      \ Benedict Shorne, a fishmonger of London, who was a rebuilder,\r\n  repairer,
      or benefactor to it; and Shorne his surname, being corrupted\r\n  into Shrog,
      was at last converted into Sherehog. This church sharing\r\n  the common fate
      of the general conflagration in 1666, and not being\r\n  rebuilt, the parish
      was annexed to that of St. Stephen\u2019s Walbrook.\r\n  _Newc. Rep. Eccl. Paroch._\r\n\r\nBENNET

      _street_, Berwick street.\r\n\r\nBERKHAMSTED, an ancient town in Hertfordshire,
      situated 30 miles to the\r\n  N. W. of London. It was anciently a Roman town,
      and here some of the\r\n  Saxon kings kept their court. William the Conqueror
      here swore to the\r\n  nobility to preserve the laws made by his predecessors;
      and here Henry\r\n  II. kept his court, and granted the town all the laws and
      liberties it\r\n  had enjoyed under Edward the Confessor. It was a borough in
      the reign\r\n  of Henry III. and James I. to whose children this place was a
      nursery,\r\n  made it a corporation, by the name of the Bailiff and Burgesses
      of\r\n  Berkhamsted St. Peter; the Burgesses to be twelve, to chuse a\r\n  Recorder,
      and Town Clerk, to have a prison, _&c._ but in the next\r\n  reign it was so
      impoverished by the civil wars, that the government\r\n  was dropp\u2019d, and
      has not been since renewed. Its market is also much\r\n  decayed. The town,
      though situated on the south side of a marsh,\r\n  extends itself far in a broad
      street, and handsome buildings, and is\r\n  pleasantly surrounded with high
      and hard ground, full of pastures,\r\n  hedgerows, and arable land. What remains
      of the castle, which is but\r\n  one third of it, was not long ago the seat
      of the Careys, and is now\r\n  the seat of the family of the Ropers. Here is
      a spacious church\r\n  dedicated to St. Peter, which has eleven of the Apostles
      on its\r\n  pillars, with a sentence of the creed on each, and on the twelfth\r\n
      \ pillar is St. George killing the dragon. The other public buildings\r\n  are,
      a free school, which is a handsome brick structure, well endowed,\r\n  the King
      being patron, and the Warden of All Souls College in Oxford,\r\n  Visitor; and
      a handsome almshouse, built and endowed by Mr. John Sayer\r\n  and his wife,
      who gave 1300_l._ for that purpose.\r\n\r\nBERKLEY SQUARE, near Hyde Park road,
      contains about three acres, and is\r\n  well built on the north, east and west
      sides.\r\n\r\n  The following is an account of the choice and valuable collection
      of\r\n  pictures and prints of John Barnard, Esq; at his house in Berkley\r\n
      \ square.\r\n\r\n  A holy family, by Parmegiano, well preserved, and the characters
      very\r\n  fine. It was out of the Count de Platembourg\u2019s collection at\r\n
      \ Amsterdam.\r\n\r\n  A crucifixion, by Paulo Veronese, about three feet high;
      there is a\r\n  fine group of figures at bottom, and the figures on the cross
      are\r\n  remarkably well drawn.\r\n\r\n  Christ calling to Zaccheus; and the
      Angel appearing to St. John in the\r\n  wilderness; both by Paulo Veronese,
      in his finest manner and highest\r\n  colouring.\r\n\r\n  A pr\xE6sepe, or nativity,
      by Jacomo Bassan; the light comes from the\r\n  child, and has a surprizing
      effect, being in his highest colouring.\r\n  These three last are upright narrow
      pictures, oval at top, and were\r\n  originally designed for some elegant little
      chapel.\r\n\r\n  Christ led to be crucified, by the same master; the colouring
      is the\r\n  richest; and the expression is much finer than one often sees of\r\n
      \ Bassan.\r\n\r\n  Adam ploughing and Eve spinning, by Domenico Fetti: this
      picture is\r\n  finely coloured, and the character of Eve is prettier than can
      well be\r\n  expressed; it was in the collection of Monsieur Biberon at Paris,
      and\r\n  Monsieur Crozat mentions it in his work, along with two others of the\r\n
      \ same subject, one of which belongs to the King of France.\r\n\r\n  A holy
      family, with a little St. John presenting a cross, by Guido.\r\n  This picture,
      which is but fifteen inches high, may be truly said to\r\n  be in his very finest
      manner; the characters of the Virgin and St.\r\n  Joseph are inexpressibly fine,
      and it is in the best preservation. It\r\n  was in the Duke de Tallard\u2019s
      collection.\r\n\r\n  The martyrdom of a female saint, by Correggio. This picture
      came out\r\n  of the same collection as the last, and is much of the same size;
      it\r\n  is in his first manner, but yet visibly of his hand; the colouring and\r\n
      \ some of the characters are fine. The Duke of Tallard had it out of the\r\n
      \ collection of Monsieur Crozat, where it was always esteemed a true\r\n  picture
      of Correggio.\r\n\r\n  A holy family, with a little St. John presenting a dish
      of fruit, by\r\n  Simone da Pesaro, commonly called Cantarini, who was the best
      disciple\r\n  of Guido. The figures are half length as big as life. True pictures
      of\r\n  this master are very scarce in England, and this is one of his best,\r\n
      \ and in the highest preservation.\r\n\r\n  The Virgin with the child in her
      lap, half length, as big as life, by\r\n  Vandyck. The character of the Virgin
      is as sweet, and the colouring as\r\n  fine, as any thing of this master\u2019s
      painting. This was out of the\r\n  collection of Monsieur Biberon, and there
      is an old print of this\r\n  picture.\r\n\r\n  A holy family, by the same master.
      This is the small picture, but the\r\n  characters of the Virgin and child,
      and the sweetness and mellowness\r\n  of the colouring, are at least equal to
      the large one. There is a\r\n  print of this by Bolswert.\r\n\r\n  A head of
      St. Peter, with a fish in his hand, by Spagnoletto. The\r\n  expression and
      force in this picture are extremely great. There is a\r\n  mezzotinto print
      engraved after it by Mr. MacArdell.\r\n\r\n  Pharoah and his host drowned in
      the Red sea, about five feet wide, by\r\n  Valerio Castelli. The character of
      Moses is very great, and the\r\n  colouring throughout is remarkably fine.\r\n\r\n
      \ The conversion of St. Paul, by Luca Jordano, with many figures and\r\n  horsemen,
      about six feet wide. This is one of his best, in the free\r\n  and spirited
      style, for which he was most famous.\r\n\r\n  A battle, by the same master,
      not quite so large. The composition in\r\n  this picture is better, and the
      figures seem more alive and in motion,\r\n  than in almost any battle pieces
      to be met with.\r\n\r\n  Tobit burying the dead, by Benedetto Castiglione, in
      the style of\r\n  Nicola Poussin, which master (in his latter time) he particularly\r\n
      \ studied and imitated; and he succeeded therein so well, in this\r\n  picture,
      both in the composition and drawing, that was not his name\r\n  upon it, several
      of the best judges have declared, they should not\r\n  only have taken it for
      a true picture of that master, but also for a\r\n  very fine one of him.\r\n\r\n
      \ A landskip, by Claude Lorrain, near four feet wide; the subject is a\r\n  warm
      evening; it is in the highest preservation, not in the least\r\n  turned black,
      and in his very finest taste and manner of painting: the\r\n  keeping, and that
      harmony and tenderness of tints, for which that\r\n  master was so famous, are
      remarkably conspicuous in this picture, and\r\n  the figures, which are but
      few, are much better than one generally\r\n  sees in his works.\r\n\r\n  A pr\xE6sepe,
      by Pietro da Cortona: the composition and the harmony of\r\n  colours in this
      picture are very fine.\r\n\r\n  The entombing of Christ, by Federico Barocci:
      the dead body is rather\r\n  disagreeable, but some of the characters are very
      fine. This was out\r\n  of the Duke D\u2019Auvergne\u2019s collection at Paris.\r\n\r\n
      \ The adoration of the Magi, by Rubens: this is only a sketch for a\r\n  large
      picture, yet it is so finished, that at a proper distance the\r\n  characters
      are as expressive, and the colouring as rich as in a\r\n  finish\u2019d picture.\r\n\r\n
      \ St. Thomas, who disbelieves putting his finger in the wound in\r\n  Christ\u2019s
      side, by Michael Angelo Caravaggio. This is also a sketch,\r\n  but the dignity
      in the characters, and the fine large folds of\r\n  drapery, shew it to be the
      work of a great master. Mr. Barnard has a\r\n  print of this picture etch\u2019d
      by the master himself, which is extremely\r\n  scarce.\r\n\r\n  The stoning
      of St. Stephen, by Filippo Lauri. Though the figures in\r\n  this picture are
      rather larger than those which are in his very best\r\n  manner, yet they are
      finely drawn, and the gaiety and beauty of the\r\n  colouring, together with
      the fine keeping observed in the distant\r\n  figures, make it a very pleasing
      and fine picture.\r\n\r\n  Christ\u2019s agony in the garden, by the same master.
      The figures in this\r\n  are smaller than in the preceding; and the fine characters,
      and\r\n  correctness of drawing of the figures, joined to the beautiful\r\n
      \ colouring, have always made this picture, though a very small one,\r\n  esteemed
      by the greatest judges as one of his best.\r\n\r\n  The same subject in a round,
      about a foot diameter, by Carlo Maratti;\r\n  the angels heads are fine, and
      the colouring pleasing. This picture\r\n  belonged to Mr. Jarvis the painter,
      who had a companion to it by the\r\n  same hand, the subject a dead Christ;
      he valued them very highly.\r\n\r\n  A holy family, by the same master, about
      one foot seven inches high;\r\n  this is painted in his best time and finest
      colouring.\r\n\r\n  A Silence, by Nicolo Poussin: the subject a landskip, the
      evening, in\r\n  which a little boy is running away with a Satyr\u2019s musical
      instrument\r\n  as he lies asleep; other figures are lying and leaning in a
      reposed\r\n  manner. Though this picture is only about seventeen inches wide,
      and\r\n  the figures but small, yet they are as genteel, and as correctly\r\n
      \ drawn, as in any of his finest pictures.\r\n\r\n  The woman taken in adultery,
      by Sebastian Ricci. The greatness of the\r\n  design the dignity and propriety
      of the characters, particularly the\r\n  woman, and the harmony of the colours,
      shew him to be (tho\u2019 a modern\r\n  master) equal to most of the greatest
      that went before him.\r\n\r\n  Two misers counting and setting down their money;
      the same subject,\r\n  but with some variation as that at Windsor, by Quintin
      Matsys of\r\n  Antwerp, who repeated this picture several times.\r\n\r\n  An
      old man\u2019s head with a ruff, painted by Rembrant. It is thought to\r\n  be
      the portrait of Ephraim Bonus the Physician, as it bears a great\r\n  resemblance
      to the print of him engraved by Rembrant himself, but in\r\n  the picture he
      is much older. The light and shade in this picture is\r\n  extremely fine. Mr.
      Houston, an excellent engraver in mezzotinto, has\r\n  engraved a very fine
      print after this picture.\r\n\r\n  A fine landskip with Tobit and the Angel,
      near three feet wide, by the\r\n  same master; the effect of colours in this
      picture is surprising.\r\n\r\n  A Magdalene\u2019s head, by Guido.\r\n\r\n  An
      historical subject, a woman and three children, _&c._ by Solimene.\r\n  This
      is better coloured, and more finished, than one generally sees of\r\n  this
      master.\r\n\r\n  Angels holding a mitre over St. Ambrose, a finished sketch
      for a large\r\n  picture, by the same master. The character of St. Ambrose is
      very\r\n  fine, and the draperies are in a great style of painting.\r\n\r\n
      \ Susannah and the Elders, by Le Moine. The colouring of the woman, who\r\n
      \ is near naked, is very fine, and the composition and the landskip are\r\n
      \ very agreeable.\r\n\r\n  A little boy and girl naked in a landskip of a garden,
      by Albano, in\r\n  his richest colouring.\r\n\r\n  A battle, by Bourgognone,
      about two feet wide; this is clearer and\r\n  better coloured than most of his
      pictures usually are.\r\n\r\n  Two landskips, by Gaspar Poussin, about two feet
      two inches wide each.\r\n  They are in his finest green manner, and extremely
      well preserved.\r\n\r\n  Another landskip, by the same master, a little larger
      but upright, and\r\n  also in his richest and best manner.\r\n\r\n  A landskip
      with rocks, and a man lying reading, by Salvator Rosa,\r\n  about two feet two
      inches wide. This is one of those pictures that\r\n  were engraved and published
      by direction of Mr. Pond some years ago:\r\n  it belonged then to Mr. Kent.\r\n\r\n
      \ A landskip, its companion, by Bartolomeo, a disciple of the above\r\n  master.
      The figures and water in this picture are remarkably fine.\r\n\r\n  A landskip,
      a warm evening, about the same size, by Jean Asselin,\r\n  commonly called Crabacci,
      with cattle in the water by Berchem in his\r\n  finest manner. Mr. Major, an
      engraver of great merit, has made a very\r\n  capital print from this picture.\r\n\r\n
      \ A landskip with cattle and figures, by Cuyp, its companion. The\r\n  sun-shine,
      for which this master is so famous, is particularly fine in\r\n  this picture.\r\n\r\n
      \ Venus and Adonis with Cupids, by Van Baelen, in a landskip about the\r\n  same
      size as the above, by Velvet Brughell, who has introduced dogs,\r\n  _&c._ painted
      with the utmost life and spirit. This is as fine a\r\n  coloured picture as
      can possibly be met with.\r\n\r\n  A landskip about the same size, with a flock
      of sheep, _&c._ by\r\n  Francesco Mille. The composition is fine, and this is
      one of his\r\n  richest pictures.\r\n\r\n  A piece of ruins, by Viviano, about
      the same size.\r\n\r\n  A piece of ruins, by Ghisolfi, with a man sitting by
      the side of the\r\n  Tiber.\r\n\r\n  A sea calm with English yachts, by William
      Vandevelde. The keeping,\r\n  the figures, and the water, are uncommonly fine
      in this picture.\r\n\r\n  A canal with boats on it, and a bridge at the end,
      with buildings on\r\n  each side, by Canaletti. This picture, for the fineness
      of the water,\r\n  and the justness of the perspective, is allowed to be one
      of the very\r\n  finest of this master.\r\n\r\n  A landskip with figures, fishing,
      &c. by Zuccharelli, about 2 feet 9\r\n  inches wide. This picture from the fineness
      of the figures, and the\r\n  uncommon richness of the colouring, has been always
      deemed at least\r\n  equal to any thing this great master ever painted.\r\n\r\n
      \ A holy family, with a little St. John sitting on a lamb, by\r\n  Scarcellini
      de Ferrara, after a design of Augustine Caracci; it is a\r\n  small picture,
      but the characters and colouring are remarkably sweet\r\n  in it.\r\n\r\n  A
      very masterly sketch of the miraculous cross of St. Antonio de\r\n  Padua, by
      Seb. Ricci. This at a little distance, has all the effect of\r\n  a finish\u2019d
      picture.\r\n\r\n  Christ and the two disciples at Emaus, by Elsheimer. The story
      is\r\n  finely told, and there is great expression in the figures: this\r\n
      \ picture is a curiosity, not only from the great scarceness of the\r\n  works
      of this master, but there are in it two different candle lights,\r\n  and a
      moon light, which have an uncommon, and yet pleasing effect.\r\n\r\n  The Virgin
      supporting a dead Christ, by Lubin Baugin, called in\r\n  France, Le Petit Guide,
      from his happy manner of imitating the stile\r\n  of that great master, of which
      this little picture, among others, is a\r\n  proof: this was out of the Duke
      de Tallard\u2019s collection.\r\n\r\n  A sea monster swimming away with a woman,
      by Albert Durer, who has\r\n  engraved a print of the same subject: this is
      extremely well\r\n  preserved, and there is a much better keeping observed in
      it than is\r\n  usual in pictures of that age.\r\n\r\n  A camelion with a thistle
      and flies, most exquisitely painted after\r\n  the life, by Van Aelst.\r\n\r\n
      \ A group of various flowers with insects in a glass of water, by a\r\n  master
      who has mark\u2019d the picture with [Albrecht Durer\u2019s mark] This in\r\n
      \ point of finishing, is perhaps carried as high as art, colours, and\r\n  the
      finest pointed pencils can possibly arrive.\r\n\r\n  A man sitting smoaking,
      and other back figures, by David Teniers. This\r\n  is in his finest stile,
      both for colouring and expression.\r\n\r\n  Two men with a little dog going
      to enter a cottage; a smaller picture\r\n  by the same master. Mr. Major has
      engraved a print from this, and\r\n  call\u2019d it the Friendly Invitation.\r\n\r\n
      \ There are other smaller pictures, good in their kind, such as the\r\n  Virgin
      and Child, by Rottenhammer, highly finished and coloured.\r\n\r\n  The same
      subject, the school of Caracci, if not of him.\r\n\r\n  The Virgin and Child
      with a bird, and a little St. John, by Sebastian\r\n  Bourdon, richer coloured
      than common of this master.\r\n\r\n  A holy family and St. Catherine, by Schidoni.\r\n\r\n
      \ An angel drawing an arrow from the side of St. Sebastian, finely\r\n  coloured
      by Gerrard Seghers.\r\n\r\n  Alpheus and Arethusa, Glaucus and Scylla, by Filippo
      Lauri, in his\r\n  best manner.\r\n\r\n  A ship on fire, by Vandevelde: the
      effect surprizingly fine.\r\n\r\n  A landskip, by Wynants, highly finish\u2019d,
      &c.\r\n\r\n  The same Gentleman has also a collection of about twelve thousand\r\n
      \ prints, engraved and etched by the most celebrated masters of the\r\n  three
      last centuries, much the greatest part of which are not only in\r\n  the highest
      preservation, but also of the finest impressions; and of\r\n  many of the matters,
      there are either all, or very near the whole\r\n  work; they are contained in
      about 50 large volumes, besides above 60\r\n  volumes in sculpture and architecture.

      ALMSHOUSE, in St. John street Bethnal green, was founded by\r\n  Mr. Bermeeter,
      for six poor women, and by him endowed with 30_l._ _per\r\n  annum_.\r\n\r\nBERMONDSEY
      SCHOOL, was founded in the year 1718, by Mr. Josiah Bacon,\r\n  who bequeatheth
      the sum of 700_l._ for purchasing land, and erecting a\r\n  school upon it,
      which he endowed with 150_l._ a year, for educating\r\n  sixty poor children
      of the parish of St. Mary Bermondsey street,\r\n  called by corruption Barnaby
      street. See _St._ MARY MAGDALEN\u2019S\r\n  BERMONDSEY.\r\n\r\n  The district
      of Bermondsey appears in William the Conqueror\u2019s survey\r\n  to have been
      a royal manor, in which were twenty five husbandmen, and\r\n  twenty-three cottagers.

      Bethlehem.\u2020\r\n\r\nBETHLEM, or BEDLAM HOSPITAL, originally a priory, was
      founded in the\r\n  year 1247, by Simon Fitzroy, of London, or according to
      Stow, Simon\r\n  Fitz Mary, Sheriff of London, on the east side of the place
      now called\r\n  the quarters of Moorfields, and of the burial ground of Old
      Bethlem.\r\n  This priory consisted of brothers and sisters, who wore a star
      upon\r\n  their copes and mantles, probably in commemoration of the star that\r\n
      \ guided the wisemen in their visit to our Saviour at his birth; and\r\n  these
      monks were to receive the Bishop and the Canons of Bethlehem,\r\n  whenever
      they should come to England. But King Henry VIII. giving this\r\n  house to
      the city of London, it was converted into an hospital for the\r\n  cure of lunatics;
      but not without a certain weekly expence, paid\r\n  either by their relations
      or the parish.\r\n\r\n  This hospital being, however, in an incommodious situation,
      and\r\n  becoming both ruinous, and unable to receive and entertain the great\r\n
      \ number of distracted persons, whose friends sued for their admission,\r\n
      \ the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council, granted the Governors a\r\n
      \ piece of ground along the south side of the lower quarters of\r\n  Moorfields,
      upon which the foundation of the present hospital was laid\r\n  in April 1675,
      and notwithstanding its being the most magnificent\r\n  edifice of its kind
      in Europe, was only fifteen months in erecting, as\r\n  appears by an inscription
      on its front.\r\n\r\n  This noble edifice is 540 feet in length, and 40 feet
      in breadth, and\r\n  is finely situated. The middle and ends, which project
      a little, are\r\n  adorned with pilasters, entablatures, foliages, and other
      ornaments,\r\n  and rising above the rest of the building, have each a flat
      roof with\r\n  a handsome balustrade of stone, in the center of which is an
      elegant\r\n  turret. That in the middle is adorned with a clock, and three dials,
      a\r\n  gilt ball, and a vane on the top.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: S. Wale
      del.   B. Green sculp. _Bethlem._]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: S. Wale del.
      \  B. Green sculp. _London Bridge._]\r\n\r\n\r\n  This building upon the whole
      shews more the good intentions, than the\r\n  good taste of the founders of
      this charity, the style of architecture\r\n  being very improper for an hospital
      for madmen. Simplicity and\r\n  regularity was all that should have been aimed
      at, and if there was a\r\n  necessity for pilasters, those of the Tuscan order
      would have suited\r\n  the design much better than Corinthian; but without regarding
      the\r\n  application, the middle pavilion, which is elegant, should have\r\n
      \ certainly been larger and more principal. The entrance is grand, and\r\n  the
      figures on the piers, one representing raving, and the other\r\n  melancholy
      madness, are finely expressed, and do honour to their\r\n  author Mr. Cibber,
      father of the late Poet Laureat. Since the first\r\n  erecting of this edifice,
      two wings have been added, in order to\r\n  contain a number of incurables.
      And before this fabric is a handsome\r\n  wall 680 feet in length, which, like
      the structure itself, is built\r\n  with brick and stone. It incloses a range
      of gardens neatly adorned\r\n  with walks of broad stone, grass plats and trees,
      wherein those of the\r\n  lunatics who are well enough to be suffered to go
      about, are allowed\r\n  to walk there and enjoy the benefit of the fresh air.
      In the middle of\r\n  this wall is a large pair of fine iron gates, and by them
      a small\r\n  entrance for the admission of those who come out of curiosity to
      visit\r\n  this hospital; on each side towards the top of these gates are placed\r\n
      \ the two statues, in the manner represented in the print.\r\n\r\n  The expence
      of erecting this edifice, besides that of building the\r\n  wings, amounted
      to near 17,000_l._\r\n\r\n  The inside chiefly consists of two galleries one
      over the other, which\r\n  cross the wings, and are 193 yards long, thirteen
      feet high, and\r\n  sixteen feet broad; without including the cells for the
      patients,\r\n  which are twelve feet deep. These galleries are divided in the
      middle\r\n  by two iron grates, by which means all the men are placed at one
      end\r\n  of the house, and all the women at the other, and in each gallery\r\n
      \ servants lie, to be ready at hand on all occasions. In the middle of\r\n  the
      upper gallery is a large spacious room, where the Governors, and,\r\n  in the
      lower, where the weekly Committee meet, and the Physician\r\n  prescribes for
      the patients; besides, above there are convenient\r\n  apartments for the steward
      of the house, the porter, matron, nurse and\r\n  servants; and below stairs
      all necessary offices for keeping and\r\n  dressing the provisions; for washing,
      and other necessary offices\r\n  belonging to so large a family; and also a
      bathing place for the\r\n  patients, so contrived, as to be an hot or cold bath,
      as occasion\r\n  requires.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _S. Wale delin._ _C.
      Grignion sc._ _Figures on Bethlem\r\n  Gate_]\r\n\r\n\r\n  There are generally
      above 200 lunatics maintained in this hospital,\r\n  each of whom has a small
      room or cell to himself, where he is locked\r\n  up on nights, and in this room
      is a place for a bed; but where the\r\n  patients are so senseless as not to
      be fit to make use of one, they\r\n  are every day provided with fresh clean
      straw. Those are judged the\r\n  fittest objects that are raving and furious,
      and yet capable of cure.\r\n\r\n  As to the method of admitting them, they are
      brought on Saturday, when\r\n  the Committee meets, to be viewed by them and
      the Physician; and if a\r\n  person be judged a fit object, a warrant is drawn
      up for his admission\r\n  by the clerk of the hospital, to be signed by the
      President, or, in\r\n  his absence, by the Treasurer. Those who put in the patient
      are\r\n  obliged to give a bond, signed by two persons, to take him away when\r\n
      \ discharged, or if he dies, to be at the expence of burying him. Their\r\n
      \ friends, who put them in, are obliged to provide them with cloaths;\r\n  but
      there is a wardrobe from whence they are supplied, when neglected\r\n  by those
      friends: for though, when raving and furious, they suffer but\r\n  little from
      the weather; yet in their intervals, they frequently\r\n  contract other distempers,
      care of which is also taken, as well as of\r\n  their lunacy, whether those
      distempers be external or internal; and\r\n  though formerly every patient paid
      5_s._ a week, they now not only pay\r\n  nothing, but after their recovery and
      leaving the hospital, are\r\n  furnished with medicines to prevent a relapse.
      When a patient is\r\n  cured, he is called before a Committee of the Governors
      and\r\n  Physicians, who examine him, and being found fit to be discharged,
      the\r\n  Physician gives a certificate to that purpose, and then the steward
      of\r\n  the house takes care to have him delivered to his friends.\r\n\r\n  The
      hospitals of Bethlem and Bridewell being made one corporation,\r\n  they have
      the same President, Treasurer, Governors, Clerk, Physician,\r\n  Surgeon, and
      Apothecary; yet each hospital has its proper steward and\r\n  inferior officers,
      and a particular committee is chosen out of the\r\n  Governors for each. Out
      of that appointed for Bethlem, there are six\r\n  who meet every Saturday, to
      examine the steward\u2019s account of expences\r\n  for the preceding week,
      and to sign it after it is approved; they also\r\n  view the provisions, examine
      the patients that are to be received or\r\n  discharged, and have the direction
      of other affairs belonging to this\r\n  hospital.\r\n\r\nBETHNAL GREEN, a village
      near Mile End, and lately one of the hamlets of\r\n  Stepney, from which parish
      it was separated by an act of parliament in\r\n  the 13th year of his present
      Majesty\u2019s reign. The old Roman way from\r\n  London led thro\u2019 this
      hamlet, and joining the military way from the\r\n  west, passed with it to Lea
      Ferry at Old Ford. Within this hamlet,\r\n  Bonner, Bishop of London, had a
      palace, and the Trinity House have a\r\n  hospital for twenty-eight decayed
      seamen, who have been masters of\r\n  ships or pilots, or their widows. See
      TRINITY HOSPITAL.\r\n\r\n  The church built pursuant to the above act, is placed
      at the north\r\n  east corner of Hare street, Spitalfields, and is a neat, commodious\r\n
      \ edifice, built with brick coped and coined with freestone; and the\r\n  tower,
      which is not high, is of the same materials. It is remarkable,\r\n  that though
      the village of itself is small, yet as part of\r\n  Spitalfields anciently belonged
      to that hamlet, this parish contains\r\n  1800 houses, and the parishioners
      are computed to amount to above\r\n  15000.\r\n\r\nBETT\u2019S _alley_, Anchor

      for small vessels, laden with\r\n  fish, oranges, lemons, Spanish onions, and
      in summer, with Kentish\r\n  cherries; here the Gravesend boats wait to take
      in their fare; and\r\n  here the woodmongers and coalmen meet at about eight
      or nine o\u2019clock\r\n  every morning, this being a kind of exchange for those
      concerned in\r\n  the coal trade.\r\n\r\n  Billingsgate is however most famous
      for being the greatest fish market\r\n  in England, and the only port for fish
      in London, which has occasioned\r\n  several acts of parliament, to prevent
      the fishmongers monopolizing\r\n  that considerable article of food. By these
      acts it is made lawful for\r\n  any person to buy fish in that market, and to
      sell it again in any\r\n  other market or place in the city of London, or elsewhere,
      by retail;\r\n  but no fishmonger, or other person, is to engross or buy more
      than\r\n  shall be for his own sale or use, on pain of forfeiting 20_l._ for\r\n
      \ every such offence, and no fishmonger, or other person, is to expose\r\n  to
      sale any fish at Billingsgate by retail that was before bought in\r\n  the same
      market.\r\n\r\nBILLINGSGATE _dock_, Thames street.\r\n\r\nBILLINGSGATE _ward_,
      is situated on the side of the Thames, and is\r\n  therefore bounded by that
      river on the south; as it is on the east by\r\n  Tower street ward, on the west
      by Bridge ward, and on the north by\r\n  Langbourn ward. It contains a part
      of Thames street, and Little\r\n  Eastcheap, which lie in the same direction,
      and those leading from one\r\n  of those streets to the other, as St. Mary at
      hill, Love lane,\r\n  Botolph\u2019s lane, Pudding lane, and on the other side
      of Little\r\n  Eastcheap, a considerable part of Rood lane, and Philpot lane.
      The\r\n  most remarkable buildings are the churches of St. Mary at hill, St.\r\n
      \ Margaret Pattens, and St. George, Botolph lane; Butchers hall, and the\r\n
      \ King\u2019s weigh-house.\r\n\r\n  This ward is governed by an Alderman, and
      ten Common Council men, one\r\n  of whom is Deputy, eleven constables, six scavengers,
      fourteen\r\n  wardmote inquestmen, and a beadle.\r\n\r\n  The jurymen returned
      by the wardmote inquest, serve as jurors in the\r\n  courts of Guildhall in
      the month of May.\r\n\r\nBILLITER _lane_, Leadenhall street. It was anciently

      square.\r\n\r\nBISHOPSGATE, is situated 1440 feet north west of Aldgate. Mr.
      Strype\r\n  imagines that it was erected by Erkenwald Bishop of London about
      the\r\n  year 675, a conjecture founded only on the effigies of two Bishops\r\n
      \ wherewith this gate was formerly adorned, and from which it might take\r\n
      \ its name: but it is probable that it was not erected so early, since\r\n  Mr.
      Stow could not find it mentioned before the year 1210.\r\n\r\n  In the reign
      of King Henry III. the Anseatic company residing in this\r\n  city, in consideration
      of several privileges granted them, obliged\r\n  themselves and their successors,
      not only to keep this gate in repair,\r\n  but to defend it, whenever it should
      be attacked by an enemy: and by\r\n  this company it was rebuilt in a beautiful
      manner in the year 1479. On\r\n  the south side over the gateway, was placed
      a stone image of a Bishop\r\n  with a mitre on his head; he had a long beard,
      eyes sunk, and an old\r\n  mortified face, and was supposed to present St. Erkenwald.
      On the\r\n  north side was another Bishop with a smooth face, reaching out his\r\n
      \ right hand to bestow his benedictions, and holding a crosier in his\r\n  left,
      who is thought to have been the courtly Bishop William the\r\n  Norman: this
      last was accompanied by two other figures in stone,\r\n  supposed to be King
      Alfred, and his son Eldred Earl of Mercia. The\r\n  present structure is a plain
      neat edifice erected in 1735. On the top\r\n  over the gateway, which is very
      lofty, is the city arms supported by\r\n  dragons; and on each side of the gate
      is a postern for the convenience\r\n  of foot passengers.\r\n\r\nBISHOPSGATE
      _street_ extends from Cornhill, thro\u2019 the gate, to Norton\r\n  Falgate,
      that part between the gate and Cornhill being called\r\n  Bishopsgate street
      within, and all without the gate, Bishopsgate\r\n  street without.\r\n\r\nBISHOPSGATE
      _ward_, which takes its name from the gate, that stands\r\n  almost in its center,
      is bounded on the south by Langbourn ward; on\r\n  the west by Broad street
      ward; and Moorfields on the east by Aldgate\r\n  ward, Portsoken ward, and part
      of the Tower liberty; and on the north\r\n  by Shoreditch: thus this ward extends
      from the bars near Spital\r\n  square, on both sides of the way, (including
      near half of Houndsditch)\r\n  as far as the pump at the corner of St. Martin\u2019s
      Outwich; and winds by\r\n  the west corner of Leadenhall, down Gracechurch street,
      to the south\r\n  west corner of Fenchurch street. The principal places in this
      ward\r\n  are, the parish churches of St. Botolph without Bishopsgate, St.\r\n
      \ Ethelburga\u2019s, and Great St. Helen\u2019s; Leatherfellers hall, Gresham\r\n
      \ college, and the London Workhouse.\r\n\r\n  This ward is under the government
      of an Alderman and two Deputies, one\r\n  within, and the other without the
      gate, six Common Council men,\r\n  thirteen wardmote inquest men, seven constables,
      seven scavengers, and\r\n  a beadle. The jurymen returned by the inquest men
      are to serve in the\r\n  several courts of Guildhall in the month of December\r\n\r\nBISSEL\u2019S

      ditch, was a monastery of that order, otherwise\r\n  called Preaching Friars.
      This monastery was erected by Robert Kilwarby\r\n  Archbishop of Canterbury,
      about the year 1276, who also built the\r\n  church of Black Friars, to which
      King Edward I. and Queen Eleanor were\r\n  great benefactors, and even the reputed
      founders. This church was\r\n  large and richly furnished with ornaments. In
      the monastery several\r\n  parliaments were held, and the Emperor Charles V.
      who was also King of\r\n  Spain, lodged there in the year 1522. There the ancient
      Kings had\r\n  their records and charters kept, as well as at the Tower: and,
      tho\u2019\r\n  this monastery was dissolved with the rest by King Henry VIII.
      yet in\r\n  the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Black Friars was inhabited by many\r\n
      \ noblemen and gentlemen; parliaments still continued to be often held\r\n  there,
      and being a place of refuge, malefactors frequently took\r\n  shelter in its
      liberties, and the inhabitants were free from arrests:\r\n  but these pernicious
      privileges have been many years lost; and as it\r\n  has been lately made part
      of the ward of Faringdon within, the\r\n  shopkeepers and tradesmen are obliged
      to be free of the city; two\r\n  Common Council men are annually elected out
      of it, and added to the\r\n  number that used to serve this ward.\r\n\r\nBLACK
      FRIARS _bridge_. The Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council of\r\n  this city,
      have been empowered by a late act, to build a bridge cross\r\n  the Thames from
      Black Friars to the opposite side in the county of\r\n  Surrey; to fill up the
      channel of Bridewell dock, or Fleet ditch, and\r\n  to purchase and pull down
      such buildings as shall be thought proper\r\n  for forming and widening streets
      and avenues. This bridge is to have a\r\n  free and open passage thro\u2019
      the arches of 750 feet at least within the\r\n  banks of the river. A sufficient
      number of glass lamps are to be fixed\r\n  on proper parts of it, to burn from
      sun setting to sun rising; and a\r\n  number of watchmen placed for the security
      of passengers.\r\n\r\n  For the erecting and support of this work, when finished,
      they are to\r\n  receive as toll, any sum they shall direct, not exceeding the\r\n
      \ following rates:\r\n\r\n  For every coach, chariot, berlin, chaise, chair
      or calash, drawn by\r\n  six horses, 2_s._\r\n\r\nDrawn by four horses, 1_s._
      6_d._\r\n\r\nDrawn by less than four, 1_s._\r\n\r\nFor every waggon, wain, cart
      or car, drawn by four or more horses, or\r\n  other beasts, 1_s._\r\n\r\nFor
      either of the same carriages drawn by less than four horses, &c.\r\n  6_d._\r\n\r\nFor
      every horse, mule or ass, laden or unladen, and not drawing, 1_d._\r\n\r\nFor
      every foot passenger on Sunday, 1_d._\r\n\r\nAnd every other day \xBDd.\r\n\r\nUpon
      the credit of these tolls, the Lord Mayor and Common Council are\r\nimpowered
      to raise any sums of money not exceeding 30,000_l._ in one\r\nyear, till they
      have raised 160,000_l._ in the whole, which they are not\r\nto exceed.\r\n\r\nBLACK
      FRIARS _school_, was founded by Peter Joy, Esq; in the year 1716,\r\n  who also
      endowed it with 160_l._ 17_s._ 3_d._ _per annum_, for\r\n  cloathing and instructing
      forty boys and thirty girls, in reading,\r\n  writing and accounts. This school
      he left in trust with the Governors\r\n  of Sion College, who allow the master
      40_l._ and the mistress 30_l._ a\r\n  year.\r\n\r\nBLACK FRIARS _stairs_, near
      Fleet ditch.\r\n\r\nBLACKHEATH, a large plain on the south of Greenwich, on
      which Watt\r\n  Tyler, the Kentish rebel, mustered 100,000 men. In this place,
      which\r\n  is admired for the fineness of its situation, and its excellent air,\r\n
      \ is a noble house built by Sir Gregory Page, Bart. a view of which we\r\n  have
      here given.\r\n\r\n  This is a very magnificent edifice, built in the modern
      taste,\r\n  consisting of a basement state and attick story. The wings contain
      the\r\n  offices and stables, which are joined to the body of the house by a\r\n
      \ colonade. It stands in the midst of a park with a large piece of water\r\n
      \ before it. The back front has an Ionic portico of four columns, but\r\n  having
      no pediment does not make so agreeable a figure as could be\r\n  wished.\r\n\r\n
      \ This is one of the finest seats in England belonging to a private\r\n  gentleman;
      it is adorned with many capital pictures, a list whereof is\r\n  here given;
      and the gardens, park, and country around, render it a\r\n  most delightful
      seat: yet this fine edifice was begun, raised, and\r\n  covered, in the space
      of eleven months. At a small distance is the\r\n  College erected by Sir John
      Morden, Bart. for a particular account of\r\n  which see MORDEN COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n

      Basinghall street, a very ancient edifice, employed\r\n  for several ages as
      a market for all kinds of woollen cloth brought to\r\n  London. This edifice
      was originally called Basing\u2019s Haugh or Hall;\r\n  probably from the family
      of the Basings, who first built the house,\r\n  and whose arms were placed in
      many parts of it, painted on the walls,\r\n  and cut in the stone-work. From
      this family, who were owners also of\r\n  the adjoining ground. Stow supposes,
      that \u201Cthe ward itself took its\r\n  name, as Coleman street ward of Coleman,
      and Faringdon ward, of\r\n  William and Nicholas Faringdon.\u201D Of this family
      the same author\r\n  observes, that Solomon Basing was Mayor in the year 1216;
      and that to\r\n  Adam Basing his son, who was also afterwards Mayor, King Henry
      III.\r\n  gave the advowson of the church at Basing Hall, and several liberties\r\n
      \ and privileges.\r\n\r\n  In the 36th year of Edward III. this house was inhabited
      by Mr. Thomas\r\n  Bakewell, whence it obtained the name of Bakewell Hall; a
      name that\r\n  was afterwards corrupted to that of Blackwell Hall. At length
      it was\r\n  purchased, with the garden and appurtenances, of King Richard II.
      by\r\n  the city, for the sum of 50_l._ and from that time has been chiefly\r\n
      \ employed as a weekly market for all the broad and narrow woollen\r\n  cloths
      brought out of the country.\r\n\r\n  This house at length growing ruinous, was
      rebuilt in the form of a\r\n  handsome store house in the year 1558, at the
      charge of 2500_l._ but\r\n  an hundred and eight years after was destroyed by
      the fire of London,\r\n  and again rebuilt in 1672; this last is the present
      edifice.\r\n\r\n  It is a square building with a court in the middle surrounded
      with\r\n  warehouses, and has two spacious entrances for carriages, one from\r\n
      \ Basinghall street, and the other opposite to it by Guildhall. This\r\n  last
      is the principal front, and has the door-case adorned with two\r\n  columns
      of the Doric order, with their entablature, and a pediment, in\r\n  which are
      the King\u2019s arms, and a little lower the city arms enriched\r\n  with Cupids,
      _&c._\r\n\r\n  In this edifice are the Devonshire, Gloucester, Worcester, Kentish,\r\n
      \ Medley, Spanish, and Blanket Halls, in which each piece of cloth pays\r\n
      \ one penny for pitching, and a half-penny per week resting; and the\r\n  profits,
      which are said to amount to about 1100_l._ _per annum_, are\r\n  applied towards
      the support of Christ\u2019s Hospital, the Governors\r\n  whereof have the whole
      management of these warehouses. There are\r\n  several statutes relating to
      the regulation of this market, with\r\n  respect to the factors, and others
      concerned.\r\n\r\nBLACKWELL HALL _court_, London Wall, Basinghall street. \u2610\r\n\r\nBLACKWELL

      a being, and yet it\r\n  has no market. The Bailiff, who returns the members,
      is annually\r\n  chosen at the Lord of the Mannor\u2019s court. The town, which
      is five\r\n  miles from Ryegate, and twenty from London, being situated on a
      hill,\r\n  on the side of Holmsdale, affords a fine prospect, as far as Sussex\r\n
      \ and the South Downs, and from some of the ruins of the castle, which\r\n  are
      still visible, tho\u2019 in the midst of a coppice, one may take a view\r\n
      \ to the west into Hampshire, and to the east into Kent. Here is a free\r\n
      \ school and an almshouse; but the spire of the church was consumed by\r\n  lightning
      and all the bells melted in the year 1606.\r\n\r\nBLEEDING HEART _yard_, Cross

      which is elegant, and was the design of\r\n  Inigo Jones. Besides the body of
      the house, are two wings, and on each\r\n  side the proper offices. One of the
      wings is a magnificent gallery in\r\n  which are copies of the Cartoons at Hampton
      Court, as large as the\r\n  originals, by Sir James Thornhill. Behind the house

      COURT. This is a court of record by prescription, and is held\r\n  every Monday
      by the Lord Mayor\u2019s steward, at the hall on St.\r\n  Margaret\u2019s hill,
      Southwark, where are tried actions for any sum of\r\n  money, damage, trespasses,

      BOTOLPH\u2019S _Aldersgate_, so denominated from St. Botolph, a monk\r\n  born
      in Cornwall, is situated at the south east corner of Little\r\n  Britain, and
      tho\u2019 the fire in 1666 did not reach this edifice, it from\r\n  that time
      fell into decay, and was great part of it rebuilt in 1757.\r\n  It is a plain
      brick edifice with a tower supported on a kind of arch\r\n  work, and crowned
      with an open turret, and its fane. It is a curacy in\r\n  the patronage of the
      Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey; but is\r\n  subject to the Bishop and
      Archdeacon of London, to whom it pays\r\n  procuration.\r\n\r\n_St._ BOTOLPH\u2019S
      _Aldgate_, situated on the east side of Houndsditch,\r\n  fronting the Minories.
      The old church escaped the fire in 1666, and\r\n  stood till the year 1741,
      when it was taken down, and the present\r\n  edifice finished in 1744. It is
      built with brick, and is a plain,\r\n  massy, and yet elegant structure. It
      consists of a body of a regular\r\n  shape, and a lofty and well-proportioned
      steeple, formed of a tower\r\n  and spire. Its greatest ornament is a bold rustic
      with which it is\r\n  strengthened at the corners. This church is a curacy,
      and the\r\n  impropriation is held in fee of the Crown. The Curate, besides
      other\r\n  considerable advantages, receives 400_l._ a year by tithes. _Newc.\r\n
      \ Rep. Eccles._\r\n\r\n_St._ BOTOLPH\u2019S _Billingsgate_, a rectory, the church
      whereof formerly\r\n  stood opposite to Botolph lane, in Thames street, in Billingsgate\r\n
      \ ward; but being destroyed by the fire of London, and not rebuilt, the\r\n
      \ parish was by act of parliament annexed to St. George\u2019s Botolph lane.\r\n\r\n_St._
      BOTOLPH\u2019S _Bishopsgate_, opposite the north end of Houndsditch.\r\n  The
      old church escaping the general conflagration in 1666, at length\r\n  fell into
      decay, and the present structure was raised by act of\r\n  parliament, at the
      expence of the parish. It is a massy and spacious\r\n  edifice. The body is
      well built with brick, and well enlightened, and\r\n  the roof hid by a handsome
      balustrade. On the inside the roof is\r\n  arched, except over the galleries,
      and two rows of Corinthian columns\r\n  support both the galleries and arch
      which extends over the body of the\r\n  church, and is neatly adorned with fret
      work, from which hang several\r\n  handsome gilt branches. The steeple, tho\u2019
      heavy, has an air of\r\n  magnificence. In the center of the front is a large
      plain arched\r\n  window, decorated at a distance with pilasters of the Doric
      order.\r\n  Over this window is a festoon, and above that an angular pediment;
      on\r\n  each side is a door crowned with windows, and over these others of the\r\n
      \ porthole kind; above these last rises a square tower crowned with a\r\n  dome,
      whose base is circular, and surrounded by a balustrade in the\r\n  same form;
      by the side of which, on the corners of the tower, are\r\n  placed urns with
      flames. From this part rises a series of coupled\r\n  Corinthian columns, supporting
      other urns like the former, and over\r\n  them rises the orgive dome, crowned
      with a very large vase with\r\n  flames. The Author of _The Critical Review_
      says, that he thinks this\r\n  steeple more in taste than most about town; and
      that the parts of\r\n  which it is composed are simple, beautiful and harmonious.
      The author\r\n  of _The English Architecture_, however, observes, \u201CThat
      the placing of\r\n  a window in the middle of the street, where the principal
      door should\r\n  have been, is an error of the first magnitude. The most unlearned
      eye\r\n  must perceive a strange imperfection in this, though without knowing\r\n
      \ what it is; and there is something in the highest degree disgustful,\r\n  at
      being shut out by a dead wall at the proper and natural entrance.\u201D\r\n
      \ But in justification of the architect, it may be alledged, that this\r\n  being
      the east end, he might not be allowed to form a door in the\r\n  center, where
      the altar is placed under a noble arch beneath the\r\n  steeple; and that much
      greater improprieties than this are daily seen,\r\n  from the idle custom which
      has generally prevailed of placing the\r\n  altar to the east in spight of any
      inconveniences it may occasion, as\r\n  in St. Clement\u2019s in the Strand,
      St. Dunstan\u2019s in Fleet street, and\r\n  many others. This church is a rectory,
      the patronage of which is in\r\n  the Bishop of London. The Rector, besides
      other considerable\r\n  advantages, receives about 200_l._ a year by tithes,\r\n\r\nBOTOLPH

      2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm
      is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable
      by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and
      new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers
      and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial
      support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical
      to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm
      collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001,
      the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide
      a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations.

      about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject
      Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support
      and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public
      domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable
      form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.
      Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining
      tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying
      with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states
      of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes
      a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith
      these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have
      not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine
      the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile
      we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not
      met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting
      unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers
      to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
      make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside
      the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check
      the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.
      Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online
      payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection
      5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor
      Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of
      a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For
      forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with
      only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks
      are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed
      as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.
      Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular
      paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main
      PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information
      about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project
      Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks,
      and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n"
