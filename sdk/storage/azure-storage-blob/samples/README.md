# Azure Storage Blob client library for Python Samples

These are code samples that show common scenario operations with the Azure Storage Blob client library.
The async versions of the samples (the python sample files appended with `_async`) show asynchronous operations.

Several Storage Blobs Python SDK samples are available to you in the SDK's GitHub repository. These samples provide example code for additional scenarios commonly encountered while working with Storage Blobs:

* [blob_samples_hello_world.py](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/samples/blob_samples_hello_world.py) ([async version](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/samples/blob_samples_hello_world_async.py)) - Examples for common Storage Blob tasks:
    * Set up a container
    * Create a block, page, or append blob
    * Upload blobs
    * Download blobs
    * Delete blobs

* [blob_samples_authentication.py](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/samples/blob_samples_authentication.py) ([async version](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/samples/blob_samples_authentication_async.py)) - Examples for authenticating and creating the client:
    * From a connection string
    * From a shared access key
    * From a shared access signature token
    * From active directory

    * Create a container and delete containers
    * Set metadata on containers
    * Get container properties
    * Acquire a lease on container
    * Set an access policy on a container
    * Upload, list, delete blobs in container
    * Get the blob client to interact with a specific blob

* [blob_samples_common.py](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/samples/blob_samples_common.py) ([async version](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/samples/blob_samples_common_async.py)) - Examples common to all types of blobs:
    * Create a snapshot
    * Delete a blob snapshot
    * Soft delete a blob
    * Undelete a blob
    * Acquire a lease on a blob
    * Copy a blob from a URL

* [blob_samples_directory_interface.py](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/samples/blob_samples_directory_interface.py) - Examples for interfacing with Blob storage as if it were a directory on a filesystem:
    * Copy (upload or download) a single file or directory
    * List files or directories at a single level or recursively
    * Delete a single file or recursively delete a directory

* [blob_samples_batch_delete_blobs.py](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/samples/blob_samples_batch_delete_blobs.py) - Examples for batch
deleting blobs
    * Delete multiple blobs at the same time.

* [blob_samples_container_access_policy.py](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/samples/blob_samples_container_access_policy.py) ([async version](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/samples/blob_samples_container_access_policy_async.py)) - Examples to
get and set access policies:

    * Start a copy from url and abort it.

* [blob_samples_enumerate_blobs.py](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/samples/blob_samples_enumerate_blobs.py) ([async version](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/samples/blob_samples_enumerate_blobs_async.py)) - Example to enumerate blobs
    * List all the blobs in a container.

* [blob_samples_walk_blob_hierarchy.py](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/samples/blob_samples_walk_blob_hierarchy.py) ([async version](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/samples/blob_samples_walk_blob_hierarchy_async.py)) - Example to walk through containers and blobs in a hierarchical structure.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.6 or later is required to use this package
* You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and an
[Azure storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview) to run these samples.

## Setup

1. Install the Azure Storage Blob client library for Python with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```bash
pip install azure-storage-blob
```

2. Clone or download this sample repository
3. Open the sample folder in Visual Studio Code or your IDE of choice.

## Running the samples

1. Open a terminal window and `cd` to the directory that the samples are saved in.
2. Set the environment variables specified in the sample file you wish to run.
3. Follow the usage described in the file, e.g. `python blob_samples_hello_world.py`
