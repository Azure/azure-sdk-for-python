# Change Log azure-storage-blob

## Version 12.0.0:

**Breaking changes**

- `set_container_access_policy` has required parameter `signed_identifiers`.
- NoRetry policy has been removed. Use keyword argument `retry_total=0` for no retries. 
- Removed types that were accidentally exposed from two modules. Only `BlobServiceClient`, `ContainerClient`, 
`BlobClient` and `LeaseClient` should be imported from azure.storage.blob.aio
- `Logging` has been renamed to `BlobAnalyticsLogging`.

**New features**

- `ResourceTypes`, and `Services` now have method `from_string` which takes parameters as a string.

## Version 12.0.0b4:

**Breaking changes**

- Permission models.
  - `AccountPermissions`, `BlobPermissions` and `ContainerPermissions` have been renamed to 
  `AccountSasPermissions`, `BlobSasPermissions` and `ContainerSasPermissions` respectively.
  - enum-like list parameters have been removed from all three of them.
  - `__add__` and `__or__` methods are removed.
- `max_connections` is now renamed to `max_concurrency`.
- `ContainerClient` now accepts only `account_url` with a mandatory string param `container_name`.
To use a container_url, the method `from_container_url` must be used.
- `BlobClient` now accepts only `account_url` with mandatory string params `container_name` and 
`blob_name`. To use a blob_url, the method `from_blob_url` must be used.
- Some parameters have become keyword only, rather than positional. Some examples include:
  - `loop`
  - `max_concurrency`
  - `validate_content`
  - `timeout` etc.
- APIs now take in `offset` and `length` instead of `range_start` and `range_end` consistently.
`length` is the number of bytes to take in starting from the `offset`. The APIs that have been 
changed include:
  - `get_page_ranges`
  - `upload_page`
  - `upload_pages_from_url`
  - `clear_page`
  - `append_block_from_url`
- `block_id` is not optional in `BlobBlock` model.

**New features**

- Add support for delete_blobs API to ContainerClient (Python 3 only)
- Add support for set_standard_blob_tier_blobs to ContainerClient (Python 3 only)
- Add support for set_premium_page_blob_tier_blobs to ContainerClient (Python 3 only)
- Added support to set rehydrate blob priority for Block Blob, including Set Standard Blob Tier/Copy Blob APIs
- Added blob tier support for Block Blob, including Upload Blob/Commit Block List/Copy Blob APIs.
- `AccountSasPermissions`, `BlobSasPermissions`, `ContainerSasPermissions` now have method `from_string` 
which takes parameters as a string.

**Fixes and improvements**
- Downloading page blobs now take advantage of their sparseness.
- The `length` param in `download_blob` now takes the number of bytes to take in starting from the `offset`
instead of a harde set end value.

**Dependency updates**
- Adopted [azure-core](https://pypi.org/project/azure-core/) 1.0.0b4
  - If you later want to revert to previous versions of azure-storage-blob, or another Azure SDK
  library requiring azure-core 1.0.0b1 or azure-core 1.0.0b2, you must explicitly install
  the specific version of azure-core as well. For example:

  `pip install azure-core==1.0.0b2 azure-storage-blob==12.0.0b2`

## Version 12.0.0b3:

**New features**
- Added SAS support for snapshot and identity.
- Distributed tracing framework OpenCensus is now supported.
- Added support for append_block_from_url API for append blobs.
- Added support for upload_pages_from_url API for page blobs.
- Added support for client provided encryption key to numerous APIs.

**Dependency updates**
- Adopted [azure-core](https://pypi.org/project/azure-core/) 1.0.0b3
  - If you later want to revert to previous versions of azure-storage-blob, or another Azure SDK
  library requiring azure-core 1.0.0b1 or azure-core 1.0.0b2, you must explicitly install
  the specific version of azure-core as well. For example:

  `pip install azure-core==1.0.0b2 azure-storage-blob==12.0.0b2`

**Fixes and improvements**
- Fix where content-type was being added in the request when not mentioned explicitly.


## Version 12.0.0b2:

**Breaking changes**
- Renamed `copy_blob_from_url` to `start_copy_from_url` and changed behaviour to return a dictionary of copy properties rather than a polling object. Status of the copy operation can be retrieved with the `get_blob_properties` operation.
- Added `abort_copy` operation to the `BlobClient` class. This replaces the previous abort operation on the copy status polling operation.
- The behavior of listing operations has been modified:
    - The previous `marker` parameter has been removed.
    - The iterable response object now supports a `by_page` function that will return a secondary iterator of batches of results. This function supports a `continuation_token` parameter to replace the previous `marker` parameter.
- Some parameters have become keyword only, rather than positional. Some examples include:
    - `timeout`
    - `lease`
    - `encoding`
    - Modification conditions, e.g. `if_modified_since`, `if_match` , `maxsize_condition`, etc

**New features**
- Added async APIs to subnamespace `azure.storage.blob.aio`.
- Distributed tracing framework OpenCensus is now supported.

**Dependency updates**
- Adopted [azure-core](https://pypi.org/project/azure-core/) 1.0.0b2
  - If you later want to revert to azure-storage-blob 12.0.0b1, or another Azure SDK
  library requiring azure-core 1.0.0b1, you must explicitly install azure-core
  1.0.0b1 as well. For example:

  `pip install azure-core==1.0.0b1 azure-storage-blob==12.0.0b1`

**Fixes and improvements**
- Fix for SAS URL encoding (#6500)
- General refactor of duplicate and shared code.


## Version 12.0.0b1:

Version 12.0.0b1 is the first preview of our efforts to create a user-friendly and Pythonic client library for Azure Storage Blobs. For more information about this, and preview releases of other Azure SDK libraries, please visit
https://aka.ms/azure-sdk-preview1-python.

**Breaking changes: New API design**
- Operations are now scoped to a particular client:
    - `BlobServiceClient`: This client handles account-level operations. This includes managing service properties and listing the containers within an account.
    - `ContainerClient`: The client handles operations for a particular container. This includes creating or deleting that container, as well as listing the blobs within that container and managing properties and metadata.
    - `BlobClient`: The client handles operations for a particular blob. This includes creating or deleting that blob, as well as upload and download data and managing properties.
    This BlobClient handles all blob types (block, page and append). Where operations can behave differently according to type (i.e. `upload_blob`) the default behaviour will be block blobs unless otherwise specified.
    - `LeaseClient`: Handles all lease operations for both containers and blobs.

    These clients can be accessed by navigating down the client hierarchy, or instantiated directly using URLs to the resource (account, container or blob).
    For full details on the new API, please see the [reference documentation](http://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-python/ref/azure.storage.blob.html).
- Copy blob operations now return a polling object that can be used to check the status of the operation, as well as abort the operation.
- New module level operations for simple upload and download using a blob URL.
- Download operations now return a streaming object that can download data in multiple ways:
    - Iteration: The streamer is an iterable object that will download and yield the content in chunks. Only supports single threaded download.
    - `content_as_bytes`: Return the entire blob content as bytes. Blocking operation that supports multi-threaded download.
    - `content_as_text`: Return the entire blob content as decoded text. Blocking operation that supports multi-threaded download.
    - `download_to_stream`: Download the entire content to an open stream handle (e.g. an open file). Supports multi-threaded download.
- New underlying REST pipeline implementation, based on the new `azure-core` library.
- Client and pipeline configuration is now available via keyword arguments at both the client level, and per-operation. See reference documentation for a full list of optional configuration arguments.
- Authentication using `azure-identity` credentials
  - see the
  [Azure Identity documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/identity/azure-identity/README.md)
  for more information
- New error hierarchy:
    - All service errors will now use the base type: `azure.core.exceptions.HttpResponseError`
    - The are a couple of specific exception types derived from this base type for common error scenarios:
        - `ResourceNotFoundError`: The resource (e.g. queue, message) could not be found. Commonly a 404 status code.
        - `ResourceExistsError`: A resource conflict - commonly caused when attempting to create a resource that already exists.
        - `ResourceModifiedError`: The resource has been modified (e.g. overwritten) and therefore the current operation is in conflict. Alternatively this may be raised if a condition on the operation is not met.
        - `ClientAuthenticationError`: Authentication failed.
- Operation `set_blob_properties` has been renamed to `set_http_headers`.
- Operations `get_blob_to_<output>` have been replaced with `download_blob`. See above for download output options.
- Operations `create_blob_from_<input>` have been replace with `upload_blob`.
- Operation `create_blob` has been renamed to separate `create_page_blob` and `create_append_blob`.
- Operations `get_container_acl` and `set_container_acl` have been renamed to `get_container_access_policy` and `set_container_access_policy`.
- Operation `snapshot_blob` has been renamed to `create_snapshot`.
- Operation `copy_blob` has been renamed to `copy_blob_from_url`.
- Operations `put_block` and `put_block_from_url` have been renamed to `stage_block` and `stage_block_from_url`.
- Operation `put_block_list` has been renamed to `commit_block_list`.
- No longer have specific operations for `get_metadata` - use `get_properties` instead.
- No longer have specific operations for `exists` - use `get_properties` instead.
- Operation `incremental_copy_blob` has been replaced by an optional boolean flag in the `copy_blob_from_url` operation.
- Operation `update_page` has been renamed to `upload_page`.
- Operation `get_page_ranges_diff` has been replaced by an optional str flag in the `get_page_ranges` operation.

- Support for write-once read-many containers.
- Added support for OAuth authentication for HTTPS requests(Please note that this feature is available in preview).

## Version 1.1.0:

- Support for 2017-07-29 REST version. Please see our REST API documentation and blogs for information about the related added features.
- Added support for soft delete feature. If a delete retention policy is enabled through the set service properties API, then blobs or snapshots could be deleted softly and retained for a specified number of days, before being permanently removed by garbage collection.

- Metadata keys are now case-preserving when fetched from the service. Previously they were made lower-case by the library.

## Version 0.37.1:

- Enabling MD5 validation no longer uses the memory-efficient algorithm for large block blobs, since computing the MD5 hash requires reading the entire block into memory.
- Fixed a bug in the _SubStream class which was at risk of causing data corruption when using the memory-efficient algorithm for large block blobs.
- Support for AccessTierChangeTime to get the last time a tier was modified on an individual blob.
