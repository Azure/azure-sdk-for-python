# Azure Storage Blob client library for Python Samples

These are code samples that show common scenario operations with the Azure Storage Blob ChangeFeed client library.
The async versions of the samples (the python sample files appended with `_async`) show asynchronous operations, 
and require Python 3.5 or later.

Several Storage Blobs Python SDK samples are available to you in the SDK's GitHub repository. These samples provide example code for additional scenarios commonly encountered while working with Storage Blobs:

* [`change_feed_samples.py`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob-changefeed/samples/change_feed_samples.py) - Examples for authenticating and operating on the client:
    * list events by page
    * list all events
    * list events in a time range
    * list events starting from a continuation token
    
## Prerequisites
* Python 2.7, or 3.5 or later is required to use this package (3.5 or later if using asyncio)
* You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and an
[Azure storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview) to run these samples.

## Setup

1. Install the Azure Storage Blob client library for Python with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```bash
pip install azure-storage-blob
```

2. Clone or download this sample repository
3. Open the sample folder in Visual Studio Code or your IDE of choice.

## Running the samples

1. Open a terminal window and `cd` to the directory that the samples are saved in.
2. Set the environment variables specified in the sample file you wish to run.
3. Follow the usage described in the file, e.g. `python change_feed_samples.py`

## Next steps
