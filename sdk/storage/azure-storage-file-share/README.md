# Azure Storage File Share client library for Python
Azure File Share storage offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry standard [Server Message Block (SMB) protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/microsoft-smb-protocol-and-cifs-protocol-overview). Azure file shares can be mounted concurrently by cloud or on-premises deployments of Windows, Linux, and macOS. Additionally, Azure file shares can be cached on Windows Servers with Azure File Sync for fast access near where the data is being used.

Azure file shares can be used to:

* Replace or supplement on-premises file servers
* "Lift and shift" applications
* Simplify cloud development with shared application settings, diagnostic share, and Dev/Test/Debug tools

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.7 or later is required to use this package. For more details, please read our page on [Azure SDK for Python version support policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/wiki/Azure-SDKs-Python-version-support-policy).
* You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and an
[Azure storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview) to use this package.

### Install the package
Install the Azure Storage File Share client library for Python with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```bash
pip install azure-storage-file-share
```

### Create a storage account
If you wish to create a new storage account, you can use the
[Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=azure-portal),
[Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=azure-powershell),
or [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=azure-cli):

```bash
# Create a new resource group to hold the storage account -
# if using an existing resource group, skip this step
az group create --name my-resource-group --location westus2

# Create the storage account
az storage account create -n my-storage-account-name -g my-resource-group
```

### Create the client
The Azure Storage File Share client library for Python allows you to interact with four types of resources: the storage
account itself, file shares, directories, and files. Interaction with these resources starts with an instance of a
[client](#clients). To create a client object, you will need the storage account's file service URL and a
credential that allows you to access the storage account:

```python
from azure.storage.fileshare import ShareServiceClient

service = ShareServiceClient(account_url="https://<my-storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net/", credential=credential)
```

#### Looking up the account URL
You can find the storage account's file service URL using the
[Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview#storage-account-endpoints),
[Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.storage/get-azstorageaccount),
or [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/storage/account?view=azure-cli-latest#az-storage-account-show):

```bash
# Get the file service URL for the storage account
az storage account show -n my-storage-account-name -g my-resource-group --query "primaryEndpoints.file"
```

#### Types of credentials
The `credential` parameter may be provided in a number of different forms, depending on the type of
[authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-auth) you wish to use:
1. To use a [shared access signature (SAS) token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview),
   provide the token as a string. If your account URL includes the SAS token, omit the credential parameter.
   You can generate a SAS token from the Azure Portal under "Shared access signature" or use one of the `generate_sas()`
   functions to create a sas token for the storage account, share, or file:

    ```python
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    from azure.storage.fileshare import ShareServiceClient, generate_account_sas, ResourceTypes, AccountSasPermissions

    sas_token = generate_account_sas(
        account_name="<storage-account-name>",
        account_key="<account-access-key>",
        resource_types=ResourceTypes(service=True),
        permission=AccountSasPermissions(read=True),
        expiry=datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(hours=1)
    )

    share_service_client = ShareServiceClient(account_url="https://<my_account_name>.file.core.windows.net", credential=sas_token)
    ```

2. To use a storage account [shared key](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/authenticate-with-shared-key/)
   (aka account key or access key), provide the key as a string. This can be found in the Azure Portal under the "Access Keys"
   section or by running the following Azure CLI command:

    ```az storage account keys list -g MyResourceGroup -n MyStorageAccount```

    Use the key as the credential parameter to authenticate the client:
    ```python
    from azure.storage.fileshare import ShareServiceClient
    service = ShareServiceClient(account_url="https://<my_account_name>.file.core.windows.net", credential="<account_access_key>")
    ```

#### Creating the client from a connection string
Depending on your use case and authorization method, you may prefer to initialize a client instance with a storage
connection string instead of providing the account URL and credential separately. To do this, pass the storage
connection string to the client's `from_connection_string` class method:

```python
from azure.storage.fileshare import ShareServiceClient

connection_string = "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=xxxx;AccountKey=xxxx;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"
service = ShareServiceClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=connection_string)
```

The connection string to your storage account can be found in the Azure Portal under the "Access Keys" section or by running the following CLI command:

```bash
az storage account show-connection-string -g MyResourceGroup -n MyStorageAccount
```

## Key concepts
The following components make up the Azure File Share Service:
* The storage account itself
* A file share within the storage account
* An optional hierarchy of directories within the file share
* A file within the file share, which may be up to 1 TiB in size

The Azure Storage File Share client library for Python allows you to interact with each of these components through the
use of a dedicated client object.

### Async Clients 
This library includes a complete async API supported on Python 3.5+. To use it, you must
first install an async transport, such as [aiohttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/).
See
[azure-core documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#transport)
for more information.

Async clients and credentials should be closed when they're no longer needed. These
objects are async context managers and define async `close` methods.

### Clients
Four different clients are provided to interact with the various components of the File Share Service:
1. [ShareServiceClient](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-storage-fileshare-shareserviceclient) -
    this client represents interaction with the Azure storage account itself, and allows you to acquire preconfigured
    client instances to access the file shares within. It provides operations to retrieve and configure the service
    properties as well as list, create, and delete shares within the account. To perform operations on a specific share,
    retrieve a client using the `get_share_client` method.
2. [ShareClient](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-storage-fileshare-shareclient) -
    this client represents interaction with a specific file share (which need not exist yet), and allows you to acquire
    preconfigured client instances to access the directories and files within. It provides operations to create, delete,
    configure, or create snapshots of a share and includes operations to create and enumerate the contents of
    directories within it. To perform operations on a specific directory or file, retrieve a client using the
    `get_directory_client` or `get_file_client` methods.
3. [ShareDirectoryClient](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-storage-fileshare-sharedirectoryclient) -
    this client represents interaction with a specific directory (which need not exist yet). It provides operations to
    create, delete, or enumerate the contents of an immediate or nested subdirectory, and includes operations to create
    and delete files within it. For operations relating to a specific subdirectory or file, a client for that entity can
    also be retrieved using the `get_subdirectory_client` and `get_file_client` functions.
4. [ShareFileClient](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-storage-fileshare-sharefileclient) -
    this client represents interaction with a specific file (which need not exist yet). It provides operations to
    upload, download, create, delete, and copy a file.

## Examples
The following sections provide several code snippets covering some of the most common Storage File Share tasks, including:

* [Creating a file share](#creating-a-file-share "Creating a file share")
* [Uploading a file](#uploading-a-file "Uploading a file")
* [Downloading a file](#downloading-a-file "Downloading a file")
* [Listing contents of a directory](#listing-contents-of-a-directory "Listing contents of a directory")

### Creating a file share
Create a file share to store your files

```python
from azure.storage.fileshare import ShareClient

share = ShareClient.from_connection_string(conn_str="<connection_string>", share_name="myshare")
share.create_share()
```

Use the async client to create a file share

```python
from azure.storage.fileshare.aio import ShareClient

share = ShareClient.from_connection_string(conn_str="<connection_string>", share_name="myshare")
await share.create_share()
```

### Uploading a file
Upload a file to the share

```python
from azure.storage.fileshare import ShareFileClient

file_client = ShareFileClient.from_connection_string(conn_str="<connection_string>", share_name="myshare", file_path="my_file")

with open("./SampleSource.txt", "rb") as source_file:
    file_client.upload_file(source_file)
```

Upload a file asynchronously

```python
from azure.storage.fileshare.aio import ShareFileClient

file_client = ShareFileClient.from_connection_string(conn_str="<connection_string>", share_name="myshare", file_path="my_file")

with open("./SampleSource.txt", "rb") as source_file:
    await file_client.upload_file(source_file)
```

### Downloading a file
Download a file from the share

```python
from azure.storage.fileshare import ShareFileClient

file_client = ShareFileClient.from_connection_string(conn_str="<connection_string>", share_name="myshare", file_path="my_file")

with open("DEST_FILE", "wb") as file_handle:
    data = file_client.download_file()
    data.readinto(file_handle)
```

Download a file asynchronously

```python
from azure.storage.fileshare.aio import ShareFileClient

file_client = ShareFileClient.from_connection_string(conn_str="<connection_string>", share_name="myshare", file_path="my_file")

with open("DEST_FILE", "wb") as file_handle:
    data = await file_client.download_file()
    await data.readinto(file_handle)
```

### Listing contents of a directory
List all directories and files under a parent directory

```python
from azure.storage.fileshare import ShareDirectoryClient

parent_dir = ShareDirectoryClient.from_connection_string(conn_str="<connection_string>", share_name="myshare", directory_path="parent_dir")

my_list = list(parent_dir.list_directories_and_files())
print(my_list)
```

List contents of a directory asynchronously

```python
from azure.storage.fileshare.aio import ShareDirectoryClient

parent_dir = ShareDirectoryClient.from_connection_string(conn_str="<connection_string>", share_name="myshare", directory_path="parent_dir")

my_files = []
async for item in parent_dir.list_directories_and_files():
    my_files.append(item)
print(my_files)
```

## Optional Configuration

Optional keyword arguments that can be passed in at the client and per-operation level.

### Retry Policy configuration

Use the following keyword arguments when instantiating a client to configure the retry policy:

* __retry_total__ (int): Total number of retries to allow. Takes precedence over other counts.
Pass in `retry_total=0` if you do not want to retry on requests. Defaults to 10.
* __retry_connect__ (int): How many connection-related errors to retry on. Defaults to 3.
* __retry_read__ (int): How many times to retry on read errors. Defaults to 3.
* __retry_status__ (int): How many times to retry on bad status codes. Defaults to 3.
* __retry_to_secondary__ (bool): Whether the request should be retried to secondary, if able.
This should only be enabled of RA-GRS accounts are used and potentially stale data can be handled.
Defaults to `False`.

### Other client / per-operation configuration

Other optional configuration keyword arguments that can be specified on the client or per-operation.

**Client keyword arguments:**

* __connection_timeout__ (int): The number of seconds the client will wait to establish a connection to the server.
Defaults to 20 seconds.
* __read_timeout__ (int): The number of seconds the client will wait, between consecutive read operations, for a
response from the server. This is a socket level timeout and is not affected by overall data size. Client-side read 
timeouts will be automatically retried. Defaults to 60 seconds.
* __transport__ (Any): User-provided transport to send the HTTP request.

**Per-operation keyword arguments:**

* __raw_response_hook__ (callable): The given callback uses the response returned from the service.
* __raw_request_hook__ (callable): The given callback uses the request before being sent to service.
* __client_request_id__ (str): Optional user specified identification of the request.
* __user_agent__ (str): Appends the custom value to the user-agent header to be sent with the request.
* __logging_enable__ (bool): Enables logging at the DEBUG level. Defaults to False. Can also be passed in at
the client level to enable it for all requests.
* __logging_body__ (bool): Enables logging the request and response body. Defaults to False. Can also be passed in at
the client level to enable it for all requests.
* __headers__ (dict): Pass in custom headers as key, value pairs. E.g. `headers={'CustomValue': value}`


## Troubleshooting
### General
Storage File clients raise exceptions defined in [Azure Core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/README.md).

This list can be used for reference to catch thrown exceptions. To get the specific error code of the exception, use the `error_code` attribute, i.e, `exception.error_code`.

### Logging
This library uses the standard
[logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) library for logging.
Basic information about HTTP sessions (URLs, headers, etc.) is logged at INFO
level.

Detailed DEBUG level logging, including request/response bodies and unredacted
headers, can be enabled on a client with the `logging_enable` argument:
```python
import sys
import logging
from azure.storage.fileshare import ShareServiceClient

# Create a logger for the 'azure.storage.fileshare' SDK
logger = logging.getLogger('azure.storage.fileshare')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Configure a console output
handler = logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout)
logger.addHandler(handler)

# This client will log detailed information about its HTTP sessions, at DEBUG level
service_client = ShareServiceClient.from_connection_string("your_connection_string", logging_enable=True)
```

Similarly, `logging_enable` can enable detailed logging for a single operation,
even when it isn't enabled for the client:
```python
service_client.get_service_properties(logging_enable=True)
```
