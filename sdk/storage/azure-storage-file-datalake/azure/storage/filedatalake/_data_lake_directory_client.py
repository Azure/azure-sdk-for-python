        The full endpoint URL to the file system, including SAS token if used.

            When creating a file or directory and the parent folder does not have a default ACL,
            the umask restricts the permissions of the file or directory to be created.
            The resulting permission is given by p & ^u, where p is the permission and u is the umask.
            For example, if p is 0777 and u is 0057, then the resulting permission is 0720.
            The default permission is 0777 for a directory and 0666 for a file. The default umask is 0027.
            The umask must be specified in 4-digit octal notation (e.g. 0766).
        :keyword str permissions: Optional and only valid if Hierarchical Namespace
         is enabled for the account. Sets POSIX access permissions for the file
         owner, the file owning group, and others. Each class may be granted
         read, write, or execute permission.  The sticky bit is also supported.
         Both symbolic (rwxrw-rw-) and 4-digit octal notation (e.g. 0766) are
