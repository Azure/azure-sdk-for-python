    """A client to interact with the DataLake directory, even if the directory may not yet exist.

    For operations relating to a specific subdirectory or file under the directory, a directory client or file client
    can be retrieved using the :func:`~get_sub_directory_client` or :func:`~get_file_client` functions.

    :ivar str url:
        The full endpoint URL to the file system, including SAS token if used.
    :ivar str primary_endpoint:
        The full primary endpoint URL.
    :ivar str primary_hostname:
        The hostname of the primary endpoint.
    :param str account_url:
        The URI to the storage account.

        The file system for the directory or files.

        The credentials with which to authenticate. This is optional if the
        account URL already has a SAS token. The value can be a SAS token string, and account
        shared access key, or an instance of a TokenCredentials class from azure.identity.
        If the URL already has a SAS token, specifying an explicit credential will take priority.

            When creating a file or directory and the parent folder does not have a default ACL,
            the umask restricts the permissions of the file or directory to be created.
            The resulting permission is given by p & ^u, where p is the permission and u is the umask.
            For example, if p is 0777 and u is 0057, then the resulting permission is 0720.
            The default permission is 0777 for a directory and 0666 for a file. The default umask is 0027.
            The umask must be specified in 4-digit octal notation (e.g. 0766).
        :keyword str permissions:
            Optional and only valid if Hierarchical Namespace
            is enabled for the account. Sets POSIX access permissions for the file
            owner, the file owning group, and others. Each class may be granted
            read, write, or execute permission.  The sticky bit is also supported.
            Both symbolic (rwxrw-rw-) and 4-digit octal notation (e.g. 0766) are
            supported.
