    """A client to interact with the DataLake directory, even if the directory may not yet exist.

    For operations relating to a specific subdirectory or file under the directory, a directory client or file client
    can be retrieved using the :func:`~get_sub_directory_client` or :func:`~get_file_client` functions.

    :ivar str url:
        The full endpoint URL to the file system, including SAS token if used.
    :ivar str primary_endpoint:
        The full primary endpoint URL.
    :ivar str primary_hostname:
        The hostname of the primary endpoint.
    :param str account_url:
        The URI to the storage account.
    :param file_system_name:
        The file system for the directory or files.
    :type file_system_name: str

        The whole path of the directory. eg. {directory under file system}/{directory to interact with}
    :type directory_name: str
    :param credential:
        The credentials with which to authenticate. This is optional if the
        account URL already has a SAS token. The value can be a SAS token string,
        an instance of a AzureSasCredential or AzureNamedKeyCredential from azure.core.credentials,
        an account shared access key, or an instance of a TokenCredentials class from azure.identity.
        If the resource URI already contains a SAS token, this will be ignored in favor of an explicit credential
        - except in the case of AzureSasCredential, where the conflicting SAS tokens will raise a ValueError.
        If using an instance of AzureNamedKeyCredential, "name" should be the storage account name, and "key"
        should be the storage account key.
    :keyword str api_version:
        The Storage API version to use for requests. Default value is the most recent service version that is
        compatible with the current SDK. Setting to an older version may result in reduced feature compatibility.
    :keyword str audience: The audience to use when requesting tokens for Azure Active Directory
        authentication. Only has an effect when credential is of type TokenCredential. The value could be
        https://storage.azure.com/ (default) or https://<account>.blob.core.windows.net.

            For example, if p is 0777 and u is 0057, then the resulting permission is 0720.
            The default permission is 0777 for a directory and 0666 for a file. The default umask is 0027.

        :keyword int lease_duration:
            Specifies the duration of the lease, in seconds, or negative one
            (-1) for a lease that never expires. A non-infinite lease can be
            between 15 and 60 seconds. A lease duration cannot be changed

        :keyword str permissions:
            Optional and only valid if Hierarchical Namespace
            is enabled for the account. Sets POSIX access permissions for the file

            read, write, or execute permission.  The sticky bit is also supported.

            ContentSettings object used to set path properties.

        :keyword str umask:
            Optional and only valid if Hierarchical Namespace is enabled for the account.
            When creating a file or directory and the parent folder does not have a default ACL,
            the umask restricts the permissions of the file or directory to be created.
            The resulting permission is given by p & ^u, where p is the permission and u is the umask.
            For example, if p is 0777 and u is 0057, then the resulting permission is 0720.
            The default permission is 0777 for a directory and 0666 for a file. The default umask is 0027.
            The umask must be specified in 4-digit octal notation (e.g. 0766).

        :keyword int lease_duration:
            Specifies the duration of the lease, in seconds, or negative one
            (-1) for a lease that never expires. A non-infinite lease can be
            between 15 and 60 seconds. A lease duration cannot be changed
            using renew or change.
        :keyword str permissions:
            Optional and only valid if Hierarchical Namespace
            is enabled for the account. Sets POSIX access permissions for the file
            owner, the file owning group, and others. Each class may be granted
            read, write, or execute permission.  The sticky bit is also supported.
