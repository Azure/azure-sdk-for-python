# AzureWebPubSub Service client library for Python

[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/signalr/azure-messaging-webpubsubservice) | [Package (Pypi)][package] | [API reference documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/signalr/azure-messaging-webpubsubservice) | [Product documentation][webpubsubservice_docs]

## Getting started

### Installating the package

```bash
python -m pip install azure-messaging-webpubsubservice
```

#### Prequisites

* Python 2.7, or 3.6 or later is required to use this package.
* You need an [Azure subscription][azure_sub], and a [Azure WebPubSub service instance][webpubsubservice] to use this package.

### Authenticating the client

In order to interact with the Azure WebPubSub service, you'll need to create an instance of the [WebPubSubServiceClient][webpubsubservice_client_class] class. In order to authenticate against the service, you need to pass in an AzureKeyCredential instance with endpoint and api key. The endpoint and api key can be found on the azure portal.

```python
>>> from azure.messaging.webpubsubservice import WebPubSubServiceClient
>>> from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
>>> client = WebPubSubServiceClient(endpoint='<endpoint>', credentials=AzureKeyCredential('somesecret'))
>>> client
<WebPubSubServiceClient endpoint:'<endpoint>'>
```

### Sending a request

```python
>>> from azure.messaging.webpubsubservice import WebPubSubServiceClient
>>> from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
>>> from azure.messaging.webpubsubservicerest import prepare_send_to_all
>>> client = WebPubSubServiceClient(endpoint='<endpoint>', credentials=AzureKeyCredential('somesecret'))
>>> request = prepare_send_to_all('default', 'Hello, webpubsub!')
>>> request
<HttpRequest [POST], url: '/api/hubs/default/:send?api-version=2020-10-01'>
>>> response = client.send_request()
>>> response
<HttpResponse http_status=202, url='api/hubs/default/:send?api-version=2020-10-01'>
>>> response.status_code 
202
```

## Troubleshooting

### Logging

This SDK uses Python standard logging library.
You can configure logging print out debugging information to the stdout or anywhere you want.

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
````

Http request and response details are printed to stdout with this logging config.
