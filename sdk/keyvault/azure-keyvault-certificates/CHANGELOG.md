# Release History

## 4.8.0b1 (2023-05-16)

### Bugs Fixed

  client's existing pipeline ([#25172](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/25172))

### Bugs Fixed
- The type hints for `KeyVaultCertificate.cer` and `DeletedCertificate.cer` are now
  `Optional[bytearray]` instead of `Optional[bytes]`
  ([#28959](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/28959))

  See https://aka.ms/azsdk/blog/vault-uri for more information.

## 4.5.1 (2022-08-11)

  https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/identity/tokencredential for more details on how to integrate

## 4.0.0b3 (2019-09-11)
Version 4.0.0b3 is the first preview of our efforts to create a user-friendly and Pythonic client library for Azure Key Vault's certificates.

 This library is not a direct replacement for `azure-keyvault`. Applications
using that library would require code changes to use `azure-keyvault-certificates`.
This package's
[documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-certificates/README.md)
and
[samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-certificates/samples)
demonstrate the new API.

### Breaking changes from `azure-keyvault`:
- Packages scoped by functionality
    - `azure-keyvault-certificates` contains a client for certificate operations
- Client instances are scoped to vaults (an instance interacts with one vault
only)
- Authentication using `azure-identity` credentials
  - see this package's
  [documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-keys/README.md)
  , and the
  [Azure Identity documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/identity/azure-identity/README.md)
  for more information

### New Features:
- Distributed tracing framework OpenCensus is now supported
- Asynchronous API supported on Python 3.5.3+
    - the `azure.keyvault.certificates.aio` namespace contains an async equivalent of
    the synchronous client in `azure.keyvault.certificates`
    - Async clients use [aiohttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/) for transport
    by default. See [azure-core documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/README.md/#transport)
    for more information about using other transports.
