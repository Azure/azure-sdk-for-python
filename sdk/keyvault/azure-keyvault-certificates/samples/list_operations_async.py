# Sample - demonstrates the basic list operations on a vault(certificate) resource for Azure Key Vault.
# The vault has to be soft-delete enabled to perform one of the following operations: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/key-vault-ovw-soft-delete
#
# 1. Create certificate (create_certificate)
#
# 2. List certificates from the Key Vault (list_certificates)
#
# 3. List certificate versions from the Key Vault (list_certificate_versions)
#
# 4. List deleted certificates from the Key Vault (list_deleted_certificates). The vault has to be soft-delete enabled to perform this operation.
