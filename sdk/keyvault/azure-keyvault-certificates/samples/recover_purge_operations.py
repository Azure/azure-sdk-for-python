# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Prerequisites:
# 1. An Azure Key Vault (https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/quick-create-cli)
#
# 2. azure-keyvault-certificates and azure-identity packages (pip install these)
#
# 3. Set up your environment to use azure-identity's DefaultAzureCredential. For more information about how to configure
#    the DefaultAzureCredential, refer to https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/identity/docs#azure.identity.DefaultAzureCredential
#

# Sample - demonstrates the basic recover and purge operations on a vault(certificate) resource for Azure Key Vault
#
# 1. Create a certificate (begin_create_certificate)
#
# 2. Delete a certificate (begin_delete_certificate)
#
# 3. Recover a deleted certificate (begin_recover_deleted_certificate)
#
# 4. Purge a deleted certificate (purge_deleted_certificate)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the keyvault is soft-delete enabled, then for permanent deletion deleted certificate needs to be purged.
