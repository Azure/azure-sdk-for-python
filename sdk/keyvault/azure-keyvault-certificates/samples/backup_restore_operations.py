# Prerequisites:
# 1. An Azure Key Vault (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/quick-create-cli)
#
# 2. azure-keyvault-certificates and azure-identity packages (pip install these)
#
# 3. Set Environment variables AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET, VAULT_URL
#    (See https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-keys#authenticate-the-client)

# Sample - demonstrates the basic backup and restore operations on a vault(certificates) resource for Azure Key Vault
#
# 1. Create a certificate (begin_create_certificate)
#
# 2. Backup a certificate (backup_certificate)
#
# 3. Delete a certificate (begin_delete_certificate)
#
# 4. Purge a certificate (purge_deleted_certificate)
#
# 5. Restore a certificate (restore_certificate_backup)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Instantiate a certificate client that will be used to call the service.
# Notice that the client is using default Azure credentials.
# To make default credentials work, ensure that environment variables 'AZURE_CLIENT_ID',
# 'AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET' and 'AZURE_TENANT_ID' are set with the service principal credentials.

# Let's create a certificate for your key vault.
# if the certificate already exists in the Key Vault, then a new version of the certificate is created.
# A long running poller is returned for the create certificate operation.
create_certificate_poller = client.begin_create_certificate(
    certificate_name=cert_name, policy=CertificatePolicy.get_default()

# The result call awaits the completion of the create certificate operation and returns the final result.
# It will return a certificate if creation is successful, and will return the CertificateOperation if not.
certificate = create_certificate_poller.result()
print("Certificate with name '{0}' created.".format(cert_name))

# Backups are good to have, if in case certificates gets deleted accidentally.
# For long term storage, it is ideal to write the backup to a file.
print("\n.. Create a backup for an existing certificate")

# The storage account certificate is no longer in use, so you can delete it.

deleted_certificate = delete_operation.result()
print("Deleted certificate with name '{0}'".format(deleted_certificate.name))

# Wait for the deletion to complete before purging the certificate.
# The purge will take some time, so wait before restoring the backup to avoid a conflict.
delete_operation.wait()
print("\n.. Purge the certificate")
client.purge_deleted_certificate(deleted_certificate.name)
