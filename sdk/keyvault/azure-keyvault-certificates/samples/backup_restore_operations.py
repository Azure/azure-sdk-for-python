# Prerequisites:
# 1. An Azure Key Vault (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/quick-create-cli)
#
# 2. azure-keyvault-certificates and azure-identity packages (pip install these)
#
# 3. Set Environment variables AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET, VAULT_ENDPOINT
#    (See https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-keys#authenticate-the-client)

# Sample - demonstrates the basic backup and restore operations on a vault(certificates) resource for Azure Key Vault
#
# 1. Create a certificate (create_certificate)
#
# 2. Backup a certificate (backup_certificate)
#
# 3. Delete a certificate (delete_certificate)
#
# 4. Purge a deleted certificate (purge_deleted_certificate)
#
# 5. Restore a certificate (restore_certificate)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Instantiate a certificate client that will be used to call the service.
# Notice that the client is using default Azure credentials.
# To make default credentials work, ensure that environment variables 'AZURE_CLIENT_ID',
# 'AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET' and 'AZURE_TENANT_ID' are set with the service principal credentials.

    # Let's create a certificate for your key vault.
    # if the certificate already exists in the Key Vault, then a new version of the certificate is created.
    # A long running poller is returned for the create certificate operation.
    create_certificate_poller = client.create_certificate(name=cert_name)

    # The result call awaits the completion of the create certificate operation and returns the final result.
    # It will return a certificate if creation is successful, and will return the CertificateOperation if not.
    certificate = create_certificate_poller.result()
    print("Certificate with name '{0}' created.".format(cert_name))

    # Backups are good to have, if in case certificates gets deleted accidentally.
    # For long term storage, it is ideal to write the backup to a file.

    print("\n.. Delete the certificate")
    client.delete_certificate(name=cert_name)
    print("Deleted certificate '{0}'".format(cert_name))

    # In future, if the certificate is required again, we can use the backup value to restore it in the Key Vault.
