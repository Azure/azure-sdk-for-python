# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Prerequisites:
# 1. An Azure Key Vault (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/quick-create-cli)
#
# 2. azure-keyvault-certificates and azure-identity packages (pip install these)
#
# 3. Set Environment variables AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET, VAULT_URL
#    (See https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-keys#authenticate-the-client)
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Sample - demonstrates the basic recover and purge operations on a vault(certificate) resource for Azure Key Vault
#
# 1. Create a certificate (create_certificate)
#
# 2. Delete a certificate (delete_certificate)
#
# 3. Recover a deleted certificate (recover_deleted_certificate)
#
# 4. Purge a deleted certificate (purge_deleted_certificate)
