# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Prerequisites:
# 1. An Azure Key Vault (https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/quick-create-cli)
#
# 2. azure-keyvault-certificates and azure-identity packages (pip install these)
#
# 3. Set up your environment to use azure-identity's DefaultAzureCredential. For more information about how to configure
#    the DefaultAzureCredential, refer to https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/identity/docs#azure.identity.DefaultAzureCredential
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Sample - demonstrates the basic CRUD operations on a vault(certificate) resource for Azure Key Vault
#
# 1. Create a new certificate (begin_create_certificate)
#
# 2. Get an existing certificate (get_certificate)
#
# 3. Update an existing certificate (update_certificate)
#
# 4. Delete a certificate (begin_delete_certificate)
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Here we use the DefaultAzureCredential, but any azure-identity credential can be used.

# if the certificate already exists in the Key Vault, then a new version of the certificate is created.

# Before creating your certificate, let's create the management policy for your certificate.
# Here you specify the properties of the key, secret, and issuer backing your certificate,
# the X509 component of your certificate, and any lifetime actions you would like to be taken
# on your certificate

# Alternatively, if you would like to use our default policy, use CertificatePolicy.get_default()
