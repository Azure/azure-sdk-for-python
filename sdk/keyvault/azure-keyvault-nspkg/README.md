# Microsoft Azure SDK for Python

This is the Microsoft Azure Key Vault namespace package. It isn't intended to
be installed directly. Key Vault client libraries are located elsewhere:
- [`azure-keyvault-certificates`](https://pypi.org/project/azure-keyvault-certificates)
- [`azure-keyvault-keys`](https://pypi.org/project/azure-keyvault-keys/)
- [`azure-keyvault-secrets`](https://pypi.org/project/azure-keyvault-secrets)

This package is for Python 2 only. It provides the necessary files for other
packages to extend the `azure` namespace. Python 3.x libraries use
[`PEP420`](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420/) instead.
