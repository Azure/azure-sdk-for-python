# Azure Key Vault Administration client library for Python

>**Note:** The Administration library only works with [Managed HSM][managed_hsm] â€“ functions targeting a Key Vault will fail.

Azure Key Vault helps solve the following problems:
- Vault administration (this library) - role-based access control (RBAC), and vault-level backup and restore options
- Cryptographic key management ([azure-keyvault-keys](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-keys)) - create, store, and control
access to the keys used to encrypt your data
- Secrets management
([azure-keyvault-secrets](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-secrets)) -
securely store and control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys,
and other secrets
- Certificate management
([azure-keyvault-certificates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-certificates)) -
create, manage, and deploy public and private SSL/TLS certificates

## _Disclaimer_

_Azure SDK Python packages support for Python 2.7 has ended 01 January 2022. For more information and questions, please refer to https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/20691._
_Python 3.7 or later is required to use this package. For more details, please refer to [Azure SDK for Python version support policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/wiki/Azure-SDKs-Python-version-support-policy)._

## Getting started
### Install packages
Install [azure-keyvault-administration][pypi_package_administration] and
[azure-identity][azure_identity_pypi] with [pip][pip]:
```Bash
pip install azure-keyvault-administration azure-identity
```
[azure-identity][azure_identity] is used for Azure Active Directory
authentication as demonstrated below.

### Prerequisites
* An [Azure subscription][azure_sub]
* Python 3.7 or later
* An existing [Key Vault Managed HSM][managed_hsm]. If you need to create one, you can do so using the Azure CLI by following the steps in [this document][managed_hsm_cli].

### Authenticate the client
In order to interact with the Azure Key Vault service, you will need an instance of either a [KeyVaultAccessControlClient](#create-a-keyvaultaccesscontrolclient) or [KeyVaultBackupClient](#create-a-keyvaultbackupclient), as well as a **vault url** (which you may see as "DNS Name" in the Azure Portal) and a credential object. This document demonstrates using a [DefaultAzureCredential][default_cred_ref], which is appropriate for most scenarios, including local development and production environments. We recommend using a [managed identity][managed_identity] for authentication in production environments.

See [azure-identity][azure_identity] documentation for more information about other methods of authentication and their corresponding credential types.

#### Create a KeyVaultAccessControlClient
After configuring your environment for the [DefaultAzureCredential][default_cred_ref] to use a suitable method of authentication, you can do the following to create an access control client (replacing the value of `vault_url` with your Managed HSM's URL):

<!-- SNIPPET:access_control_operations.create_an_access_control_client -->

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultAccessControlClient

MANAGED_HSM_URL = os.environ["MANAGED_HSM_URL"]
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = KeyVaultAccessControlClient(vault_url=MANAGED_HSM_URL, credential=credential)
```

<!-- END SNIPPET -->

> **NOTE:** For an asynchronous client, import `azure.keyvault.administration.aio`'s `KeyVaultAccessControlClient` instead.

#### Create a KeyVaultBackupClient
After configuring your environment for the [DefaultAzureCredential][default_cred_ref] to use a suitable method of authentication, you can do the following to create a backup client (replacing the value of `vault_url` with your Managed HSM's URL):

<!-- SNIPPET:backup_restore_operations.create_a_backup_restore_client -->

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultBackupClient

MANAGED_HSM_URL = os.environ["MANAGED_HSM_URL"]
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = KeyVaultBackupClient(vault_url=MANAGED_HSM_URL, credential=credential)
```

<!-- END SNIPPET -->

> **NOTE:** For an asynchronous client, import `azure.keyvault.administration.aio`'s `KeyVaultBackupClient` instead.

#### Create a KeyVaultSettingsClient
After configuring your environment for the [DefaultAzureCredential][default_cred_ref] to use a suitable method of authentication, you can do the following to create a settings client (replacing the value of `vault_url` with your Managed HSM's URL):

<!-- SNIPPET:settings_operations.create_a_settings_client -->

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultSettingsClient

MANAGED_HSM_URL = os.environ["MANAGED_HSM_URL"]
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = KeyVaultSettingsClient(vault_url=MANAGED_HSM_URL, credential=credential)
```

<!-- END SNIPPET -->

> **NOTE:** For an asynchronous client, import `azure.keyvault.administration.aio`'s `KeyVaultSettingsClient` instead.

## Key concepts

### Role definition
A role definition defines the operations that can be performed, such as read, write, and delete. It can also define the operations that are excluded from allowed operations.

A role definition is specified as part of a role assignment.

### Role assignment
A role assignment is the association of a role definition to a service principal. They can be created, listed, fetched individually, and deleted.

### KeyVaultAccessControlClient
A `KeyVaultAccessControlClient` manages role definitions and role assignments.

### KeyVaultBackupClient
A `KeyVaultBackupClient` performs full key backups, full key restores, and selective key restores.

### KeyVaultSettingsClient

A `KeyVaultSettingsClient` manages Managed HSM account settings.

## Examples
This section contains code snippets covering common tasks:
* Access control
    * [List all role definitions](#list-all-role-definitions)
    * [Set, get, and delete a role definition](#set-get-and-delete-a-role-defintion)
    * [List all role assignments](#list-all-role-assignments)
    * [Create, get, and delete a role assignment](#create-get-and-delete-a-role-assignment)
* Backup and restore
    * [Perform a full key backup](#perform-a-full-key-backup)
    * [Perform a full key restore](#perform-a-full-key-restore)
    * [Perform a selective key restore](#perform-a-selective-key-restore)

### List all role definitions
`list_role_definitions` can be used by a `KeyVaultAccessControlClient` to list the role definitions available for
assignment.

<!-- SNIPPET:access_control_operations.list_role_definitions -->

```python
from azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultRoleScope

role_definitions = client.list_role_definitions(scope=KeyVaultRoleScope.GLOBAL)
for definition in role_definitions:
    print(f"Role name: {definition.role_name}; Role definition name: {definition.name}")
```

<!-- END SNIPPET -->

### Set, get, and delete a role definition

`set_role_definition` can be used by a `KeyVaultAccessControlClient` to either create a custom role definition or update
an existing definition with the specified unique `name` (a UUID).

<!-- SNIPPET:access_control_operations.create_a_role_definition -->

```python
from azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultDataAction, KeyVaultPermission, KeyVaultRoleScope

role_name = "customRole"
scope = KeyVaultRoleScope.GLOBAL
permissions = [KeyVaultPermission(data_actions=[KeyVaultDataAction.CREATE_HSM_KEY])]
role_definition = client.set_role_definition(scope=scope, role_name=role_name, permissions=permissions)
```

<!-- END SNIPPET -->

<!-- SNIPPET:access_control_operations.update_a_role_definition -->

```python
new_permissions = [
    KeyVaultPermission(
        data_actions=[KeyVaultDataAction.READ_HSM_KEY],
        not_data_actions=[KeyVaultDataAction.CREATE_HSM_KEY]
    )
]
unique_definition_name = role_definition.name
updated_definition = client.set_role_definition(
    scope=scope, name=unique_definition_name, role_name=role_name, permissions=new_permissions
)
```

<!-- END SNIPPET -->

`get_role_definition` can be used by a `KeyVaultAccessControlClient` to fetch a role definition with the specified scope
and unique name.

<!-- SNIPPET:access_control_operations.get_a_role_definition -->

```python
fetched_definition = client.get_role_definition(scope=scope, name=unique_definition_name)
```

<!-- END SNIPPET -->

`delete_role_definition` can be used by a `KeyVaultAccessControlClient` to delete a role definition with the specified
scope and unique name.

<!-- SNIPPET:access_control_operations.delete_a_role_definition -->

```python
client.delete_role_definition(scope=scope, name=unique_definition_name)
```

<!-- END SNIPPET -->

### List all role assignments
`list_role_assignments` can be used by a `KeyVaultAccessControlClient` to list all of the current role assignments.

<!-- SNIPPET:access_control_operations.list_role_assignments -->

```python
from azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultRoleScope

role_assignments = client.list_role_assignments(KeyVaultRoleScope.GLOBAL)
for assignment in role_assignments:
    print(f"Role assignment name: {assignment.name}")
    print(f"Principal ID associated with this assignment: {assignment.properties.principal_id}")
```

<!-- END SNIPPET -->

### Create, get, and delete a role assignment
Role assignments assign a role to a service principal. This will require a role definition ID and service principal
object ID. You can use an ID from the retrieved [list of role definitions](#list-all-role-definitions) for the former,
and an assignment's `principal_id` from the list retrieved in the [above snippet](#list-all-role-assignments) for the
latter. Provide these values, and a scope, to a `KeyVaultAccessControlClient`'s `create_role_assignment` method.

<!-- SNIPPET:access_control_operations.create_a_role_assignment -->

```python
from azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultRoleScope

scope = KeyVaultRoleScope.GLOBAL
role_assignment = client.create_role_assignment(scope=scope, definition_id=definition_id, principal_id=principal_id)
print(f"Role assignment {role_assignment.name} created successfully.")
```

<!-- END SNIPPET -->

`get_role_assignment` can be used by a `KeyVaultAccessControlClient` to fetch an existing role assignment with the
specified scope and unique name.

<!-- SNIPPET:access_control_operations.get_a_role_assignment -->

```python
fetched_assignment = client.get_role_assignment(scope=scope, name=role_assignment.name)
print(f"Role assignment for principal {fetched_assignment.properties.principal_id} fetched successfully.")
```

<!-- END SNIPPET -->

`delete_role_assignment` can be used by a `KeyVaultAccessControlClient` to delete a role assignment with the specified
scope and unique name.

<!-- SNIPPET:access_control_operations.delete_a_role_assignment -->

```python
client.delete_role_assignment(scope=scope, name=role_assignment.name)
```

<!-- END SNIPPET -->

### Perform a full key backup
The `KeyVaultBackupClient` can be used to back up your entire collection of keys. The backing store for full key
backups is a blob storage container using Shared Access Signature (SAS) authentication.

For more details on creating a SAS token using a `BlobServiceClient` from [`azure-storage-blob`][storage_blob], refer
to the library's [credential documentation][sas_docs]. Alternatively, it is possible to
[generate a SAS token in Storage Explorer][storage_explorer].

<!-- SNIPPET:backup_restore_operations.begin_backup -->

```python
CONTAINER_URL = os.environ["CONTAINER_URL"]
SAS_TOKEN = os.environ["SAS_TOKEN"]

backup_result = client.begin_backup(CONTAINER_URL, SAS_TOKEN).result()
print(f"Azure Storage Blob URL of the backup: {backup_result.folder_url}")
```

<!-- END SNIPPET -->

Note that the `begin_backup` method returns a poller. Calling `result()` on this poller returns a
`KeyVaultBackupResult` containing information about the backup. Calling `wait()` on the poller will instead block until
the operation is complete without returning an object.

### Perform a full key restore
The `KeyVaultBackupClient` can be used to restore your entire collection of keys from a backup. The data source for a
full key restore is a storage blob accessed using Shared Access Signature authentication. You will also need the URL of
the backup (`KeyVaultBackupResult.folder_url`) from the [above snippet](#perform-a-full-key-backup).

For more details on creating a SAS token using a `BlobServiceClient` from [`azure-storage-blob`][storage_blob], refer
to the library's [credential documentation][sas_docs]. Alternatively, it is possible to
[generate a SAS token in Storage Explorer][storage_explorer].

<!-- SNIPPET:backup_restore_operations.begin_backup -->

```python
client.begin_restore(backup_result.folder_url, SAS_TOKEN).wait()
```

<!-- END SNIPPET -->

Note that the `begin_restore` method returns a poller. Unlike the poller returned by `begin_backup`, this poller's
`result` method returns `None`; therefore, calling `wait()` is functionally the same.

### Perform a selective key restore

To restore a single key from a backed up vault instead of all keys, provide the key name as a `key_name` argument to the
`begin_restore` method [shown above](#perform-a-full-key-restore).

## Troubleshooting

See the `azure-keyvault-administration`
[troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-administration/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
for details on how to diagnose various failure scenarios.

### General
Key Vault clients raise exceptions defined in [azure-core][azure_core_exceptions].
For example, if you try to get a role assignment that doesn't exist, KeyVaultAccessControlClient
raises [ResourceNotFoundError](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-core-exceptions-resource-not-found-error):

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultAccessControlClient
from azure.core.exceptions import ResourceNotFoundError

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = KeyVaultAccessControlClient(vault_url="https://my-managed-hsm-name.managedhsm.azure.net/", credential=credential)

try:
    client.get_role_assignment("/", "which-does-not-exist")
except ResourceNotFoundError as e:
    print(e.message)
```

Clients from the Administration library can only be used to perform operations on a managed HSM, so attempting to do so on a Key Vault will raise an error.

## Next steps
