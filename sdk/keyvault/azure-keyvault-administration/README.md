# Azure Key Vault Administration client library for Python

>**Note:** The Administration library only works with [Managed HSM][managed_hsm] â€“ functions targeting a Key Vault will fail.

Azure Key Vault helps solve the following problems:
- Vault administration (this library) - role-based access control (RBAC), and vault-level backup and restore options
- Cryptographic key management ([azure-keyvault-keys](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-keys)) - create, store, and control
access to the keys used to encrypt your data
- Secrets management
([azure-keyvault-secrets](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-secrets)) -
securely store and control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys,
and other secrets
- Certificate management
([azure-keyvault-certificates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-certificates)) -
create, manage, and deploy public and private SSL/TLS certificates

## _Disclaimer_

_Azure SDK Python packages support for Python 2.7 has ended 01 January 2022. For more information and questions, please refer to https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/20691._
_Python 3.7 or later is required to use this package. For more details, please refer to [Azure SDK for Python version support policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/wiki/Azure-SDKs-Python-version-support-policy)._

## Getting started
### Install packages
Install [azure-keyvault-administration][pypi_package_administration] and
[azure-identity][azure_identity_pypi] with [pip][pip]:
```Bash
pip install azure-keyvault-administration azure-identity
```
[azure-identity][azure_identity] is used for Azure Active Directory
authentication as demonstrated below.

### Prerequisites
* An [Azure subscription][azure_sub]
* Python 3.7 or later
* An existing [Key Vault Managed HSM][managed_hsm]. If you need to create one, you can do so using the Azure CLI by following the steps in [this document][managed_hsm_cli].

### Authenticate the client
In order to interact with the Azure Key Vault service, you will need an instance of either a [KeyVaultAccessControlClient](#create-a-keyvaultaccesscontrolclient) or [KeyVaultBackupClient](#create-a-keyvaultbackupclient), as well as a **vault url** (which you may see as "DNS Name" in the Azure Portal) and a credential object. This document demonstrates using a [DefaultAzureCredential][default_cred_ref], which is appropriate for most scenarios, including local development and production environments. We recommend using a [managed identity][managed_identity] for authentication in production environments.

See [azure-identity][azure_identity] documentation for more information about other methods of authentication and their corresponding credential types.

#### Create a KeyVaultAccessControlClient
After configuring your environment for the [DefaultAzureCredential][default_cred_ref] to use a suitable method of authentication, you can do the following to create an access control client (replacing the value of `vault_url` with your Managed HSM's URL):
```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultAccessControlClient

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

client = KeyVaultAccessControlClient(
    vault_url="https://my-managed-hsm-name.managedhsm.azure.net/",
    credential=credential
)
```

> **NOTE:** For an asynchronous client, import `azure.keyvault.administration.aio`'s `KeyVaultAccessControlClient` instead.

#### Create a KeyVaultBackupClient
After configuring your environment for the [DefaultAzureCredential][default_cred_ref] to use a suitable method of authentication, you can do the following to create a backup client (replacing the value of `vault_url` with your Managed HSM's URL):
```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultBackupClient

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

client = KeyVaultBackupClient(
    vault_url="https://my-managed-hsm-name.managedhsm.azure.net/",
    credential=credential
)
```

> **NOTE:** For an asynchronous client, import `azure.keyvault.administration.aio`'s `KeyVaultBackupClient` instead.

## Key concepts

### Role definition
A role definition defines the operations that can be performed, such as read, write, and delete. It can also define the operations that are excluded from allowed operations.

A role definition is specified as part of a role assignment.

### Role assignment
A role assignment is the association of a role definition to a service principal. They can be created, listed, fetched individually, and deleted.

### KeyVaultAccessControlClient
A `KeyVaultAccessControlClient` manages role definitions and role assignments.

### KeyVaultBackupClient
A `KeyVaultBackupClient` performs full key backups, full key restores, and selective key restores.

## Examples
This section contains code snippets covering common tasks:
* Access control
    * [List all role definitions](#list-all-role-definitions)
    * [Set, get, and delete a role definition](#set-get-and-delete-a-role-defintion)
    * [List all role assignments](#list-all-role-assignments)
    * [Create, get, and delete a role assignment](#create-get-and-delete-a-role-assignment)
* Backup and restore
    * [Perform a full key backup](#perform-a-full-key-backup)
    * [Perform a full key restore](#perform-a-full-key-restore)

### List all role definitions
List the role definitions available for assignment.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultAccessControlClient, KeyVaultRoleScope

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

client = KeyVaultAccessControlClient(
    vault_url="https://my-managed-hsm-name.managedhsm.azure.net/",
    credential=credential
)

# this will list all role definitions available for assignment
role_definitions = client.list_role_definitions(KeyVaultRoleScope.GLOBAL)

for definition in role_definitions:
    print(definition.id)
    print(definition.role_name)
    print(definition.description)
```

### Set, get, and delete a role definition

`set_role_definition` can be used to either create a custom role definition or update an existing definition with the specified name.

```python
import uuid
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.administration import (
    KeyVaultAccessControlClient,
    KeyVaultDataAction,
    KeyVaultPermission,
    KeyVaultRoleScope
)

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

client = KeyVaultAccessControlClient(
    vault_url="https://my-managed-hsm-name.managedhsm.azure.net/",
    credential=credential
)

# create a custom role definition
permissions = [KeyVaultPermission(allowed_data_actions=[KeyVaultDataAction.READ_HSM_KEY])]
created_definition = client.set_role_definition(KeyVaultRoleScope.GLOBAL, permissions=permissions)

# update the custom role definition
permissions = [
    KeyVaultPermission(allowed_data_actions=[], denied_data_actions=[KeyVaultDataAction.READ_HSM_KEY])
]
updated_definition = client.set_role_definition(
    KeyVaultRoleScope.GLOBAL, permissions=permissions, role_name=created_definition.name
)

# get the custom role definition
definition = client.get_role_definition(KeyVaultRoleScope.GLOBAL, role_name=definition_name)

# delete the custom role definition
deleted_definition = client.delete_role_definition(KeyVaultRoleScope.GLOBAL, role_name=definition_name)
```

### List all role assignments
Before creating a new role assignment in the [next snippet](#create-get-and-delete-a-role-assignment), list all of the current role assignments:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultAccessControlClient, KeyVaultRoleScope

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

client = KeyVaultAccessControlClient(
    vault_url="https://my-managed-hsm-name.managedhsm.azure.net/",
    credential=credential
)

# this will list all role assignments
role_assignments = client.list_role_assignments(KeyVaultRoleScope.GLOBAL)

for assignment in role_assignments:
    print(assignment.name)
    print(assignment.principal_id)
    print(assignment.role_definition_id)
```

### Create, get, and delete a role assignment
Assign a role to a service principal. This will require a role definition ID and service principal object ID. You can use an ID from the retrieved [list of role definitions](#list-all-role-definitions) for the former, and an assignment's `principal_id` from the list retrieved in the [above snippet](#list-all-role-assignments) for the latter.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultAccessControlClient, KeyVaultRoleScope

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

client = KeyVaultAccessControlClient(
    vault_url="https://my-managed-hsm-name.managedhsm.azure.net/",
    credential=credential
)

# Replace <role-definition-id> with the id of a definition from the fetched list from an earlier example
role_definition_id = "<role-definition-id>"
# Replace <service-principal-object-id> with the principal_id of an assignment returned from the previous example
principal_id = "<service-principal-object-id>"

# first, let's create the role assignment
role_assignment = client.create_role_assignment(KeyVaultRoleScope.GLOBAL, role_definition_id, principal_id)
print(role_assignment.name)
print(role_assignment.principal_id)
print(role_assignment.role_definition_id)

# now, we get it
role_assignment = client.get_role_assignment(KeyVaultRoleScope.GLOBAL, role_assignment.name)
print(role_assignment.name)
print(role_assignment.principal_id)
print(role_assignment.role_definition_id)

# finally, we delete this role assignment
role_assignment = client.delete_role_assignment(KeyVaultRoleScope.GLOBAL, role_assignment.name)
print(role_assignment.name)
print(role_assignment.principal_id)
print(role_assignment.role_definition_id)
```

### Perform a full key backup
Back up your entire collection of keys. The backing store for full key backups is a blob storage container using Shared Access Signature authentication.

For more details on creating a SAS token using the `BlobServiceClient`, see the sample [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/samples/blob_samples_authentication.py#L105).
Alternatively, it is possible to [generate a SAS token in Storage Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer?tabs=windows#generate-a-shared-access-signature-in-storage-explorer)

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultBackupClient

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = KeyVaultBackupClient(vault_url="https://my-managed-hsm-name.managedhsm.azure.net/", credential=credential)

# blob storage container URL, for example https://<account name>.blob.core.windows.net/backup
blob_storage_url = "<your-blob-storage-url>"
sas_token = "<your-sas-token>"  # replace with a sas token to your storage account

# Backup is a long-running operation. The client returns a poller object whose result() method
# blocks until the backup is complete, then returns an object representing the backup operation.
backup_poller = client.begin_backup(blob_storage_url, sas_token)
backup_operation = backup_poller.result()

# this is the Azure Storage Blob URL of the backup
print(backup_operation.folder_url)
```


### Perform a full key restore
Restore your entire collection of keys from a backup. The data source for a full key restore is a storage blob accessed using Shared Access Signature authentication.
You will also need the `azure_storage_blob_container_uri` from the [above snippet](#perform-a-full-key-backup).

For more details on creating a SAS token using the `BlobServiceClient`, see the sample [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/samples/blob_samples_authentication.py#L105).
Alternatively, it is possible to [generate a SAS token in Storage Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer?tabs=windows#generate-a-shared-access-signature-in-storage-explorer)

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultBackupClient

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = KeyVaultBackupClient(vault_url="https://my-managed-hsm-name.managedhsm.azure.net/", credential=credential)

sas_token = "<your-sas-token>"  # replace with a sas token to your storage account

# URL to a storage blob, for example https://<account name>.blob.core.windows.net/backup/mhsm-account-2020090117323313
blob_url = "<your-blob-url>"

# Restore is a long-running operation. The client returns a poller object whose wait() method
# blocks until the restore is complete.
restore_poller = client.begin_restore(blob_url, sas_token)
restore_poller.wait()
```

## Troubleshooting

See the `azure-keyvault-administration`
[troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-administration/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
for details on how to diagnose various failure scenarios.

### General
Key Vault clients raise exceptions defined in [azure-core][azure_core_exceptions].
For example, if you try to get a role assignment that doesn't exist, KeyVaultAccessControlClient
raises [ResourceNotFoundError](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-core-exceptions-resource-not-found-error):

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultAccessControlClient
from azure.core.exceptions import ResourceNotFoundError

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = KeyVaultAccessControlClient(vault_url="https://my-managed-hsm-name.managedhsm.azure.net/", credential=credential)

try:
    client.get_role_assignment("/", "which-does-not-exist")
except ResourceNotFoundError as e:
    print(e.message)
```

Clients from the Administration library can only be used to perform operations on a managed HSM, so attempting to do so on a Key Vault will raise an error.

## Next steps
Several samples are available in the Azure SDK for Python GitHub repository. These samples provide example code for additional Key Vault scenarios:
| File | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| [access_control_operations.py][access_control_operations_sample] | create/update/delete role definitions and role assignments |
| [access_control_operations_async.py][access_control_operations_async_sample] | create/update/delete role definitions and role assignments with an async client |
| [backup_restore_operations.py][backup_operations_sample] | full backup and restore |
| [backup_restore_operations_async.py][backup_operations_async_sample] | full backup and restore with an async client |
