# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Prerequisites:
# 1. A managed HSM (https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/managed-hsm/quick-create-cli)
#
# 2. azure-keyvault-administration and azure-identity libraries (pip install these)
#
# 3. Set environment variable MANAGED_HSM_URL with the URL of your managed HSM
#
# 4. A user-assigned managed identity that has access to your managed HSM. For more information about how to create a
#    user-assigned managed identity, refer to
#    https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview
#    
# 5. A storage account, that your managed identity has access to, containing a blob storage container
#    (See https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction)
#
# 6. Set environment variables CONTAINER_URL and CLIENT_ID, corresponding to your blob container's URI and your
#    user-assigned managed identity's client ID, respectively.
#
# For more details, see https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/managed-hsm/backup-restore

# Sample - demonstrates full backup and restore operations for Managed HSM
#
# 1. Perform a full backup (begin_backup)
#
# 2. Perform a full restore (begin_restore)
