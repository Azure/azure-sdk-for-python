# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Prerequisites:
# 1. An Azure Key Vault (https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/quick-create-cli)
#
# 2. azure-keyvault-secrets and azure-identity libraries (pip install these)
#
# 3. Set up your environment to use azure-identity's DefaultAzureCredential. For more information about how to configure
#    the DefaultAzureCredential, refer to https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/identity/docs#azure.identity.DefaultAzureCredential
#

# Sample - demonstrates the basic list operations on a vault(secret) resource for Azure Key Vault.
# The vault has to be soft-delete enabled to perform one of the following operations. See
# https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-ovw-soft-delete for more information about soft-delete.
#
# 1. Create secret (set_secret)
#
# 2. List secrets from the Key Vault (list_secrets)
#
# 3. List secret versions from the Key Vault (list_properties_of_secret_versions)
#
# 4. List deleted secrets from the Key Vault (list_deleted_secrets). The vault has to be soft-delete enabled to perform
# this operation.

# Instantiate a secret client that will be used to call the service. Notice that the client is using default Azure
# credentials. To make default credentials work, ensure that environment variables 'AZURE_CLIENT_ID',
# 'AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET' and 'AZURE_TENANT_ID' are set with the service principal credentials.

# The bank account and storage accounts got closed. Let's delete bank and storage accounts secrets.
# Calling result() on the method will immediately return the `DeletedSecret`, but calling wait() blocks
# until the secret is deleted server-side.
print("\n.. Deleting secrets...")
