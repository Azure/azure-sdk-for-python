# Prerequisites:
# 1. An Azure Key Vault (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/quick-create-cli)
#
# 2. azure-keyvault-secrets and azure-identity libraries (pip install these)
#
# 3. Set Environment variables AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET, VAULT_URL
#    (See https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-keys#authenticate-the-client)

# Sample - demonstrates the basic list operations on a vault(secret) resource for Azure Key Vault.
# The vault has to be soft-delete enabled to perform one of the following operations. See
# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/key-vault-ovw-soft-delete for more information about soft-delete.
#
# 1. Create secret (set_secret)
#
# 2. List secrets from the Key Vault (list_secrets)
#
# 3. List secret versions from the Key Vault (list_properties_of_secret_versions)
#
# 4. List deleted secrets from the Key Vault (list_deleted_secrets). The vault has to be soft-delete enabled to perform
# this operation.
#
