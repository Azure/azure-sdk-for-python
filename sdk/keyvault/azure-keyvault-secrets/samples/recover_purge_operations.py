# Sample - demonstrates the basic recover and purge operations on a vault(secret) resource for Azure Key Vault. The vault
# has to be soft-delete enabled to perform the following operations. See for more information about soft delete:
# # https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/key-vault-ovw-soft-delete
#
# 1. Create a secret (set_secret)
#
# 2. Delete a secret (delete_secret)
#
# 3. Recover a deleted secret (recover_deleted_secret)
#
# 4. Purge a deleted secret (purge_deleted_secret)
