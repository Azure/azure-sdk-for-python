## 4.7.0 (2023-03-16)

### Features Added
- Added support for service API version `7.4`
- Clients each have a `send_request` method that can be used to send custom requests using the
  client's existing pipeline ([#25172](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/25172))

### Breaking Changes
- Clients verify the challenge resource matches the vault domain. This should affect few customers,
  who can provide `verify_challenge_resource=False` to client constructors to disable.
  See https://aka.ms/azsdk/blog/vault-uri for more information.

  https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/identity/tokencredential for more details on how to integrate

### Changed
- Key Vault API version 7.2 is now the default
- Updated minimum `msrest` version to 0.6.21

### Added
- Added class `KeyVaultSecretIdentifier` that parses out a full ID returned by Key Vault,
  so users can easily access the secret's `name`, `vault_url`, and `version`.

Used as a context manager, a `SecretClient` closes opened sockets on exit.
([#9906](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/9906))
- Pollers no longer sleep after operation completion
([#9991](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/9991))

## 4.0.1 (2020-02-11)

([#9690](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/9690))

## 4.0.0 (2019-10-31)
### Breaking changes:
- Moved optional parameters of two methods into kwargs (
[docs](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/python/azure-keyvault-secrets/4.0.0/azure.keyvault.secrets.html)
detail the new keyword arguments):
  - `set_secret` now has positional parameters `name` and `value`
  - `update_secret_properties` now has positional parameters `name` and
    (optional) `version`
- Renamed `list_secrets` to `list_properties_of_secrets`
- Renamed `list_secret_versions` to `list_properties_of_secret_versions`
- Renamed sync method `delete_secret` to `begin_delete_secret`
- The sync method `begin_delete_secret` and async `delete_secret` now return pollers that return a `DeletedSecret`
- Renamed `Secret` to `KeyVaultSecret`
- `KeyVaultSecret`  properties `created`, `expires`, and `updated` renamed to `created_on`,
`expires_on`, and `updated_on`
- The `vault_endpoint` parameter of `SecretClient` has been renamed to `vault_url`
- The property `vault_endpoint` has been renamed to `vault_url` in all models


## 4.0.0b4 (2019-10-08)
### Breaking changes:
- `Secret` now has attribute `properties`, which holds certain properties of the
secret, such as `version`. This changes the shape of the returned `Secret` type,
as certain properties of `Secret` (such as `version`) have to be accessed
through the `properties` property.

- `update_secret` has been renamed to `update_secret_properties`
- The `vault_url` parameter of `SecretClient` has been renamed to `vault_endpoint`
- The property `vault_url` has been renamed to `vault_endpoint` in all models

### Fixes and improvements
- `list_secrets` and `list_secret_versions` return the correct type

## 4.0.0b3 (2019-09-11)
This release includes only internal changes.

## 4.0.0b2 (2019-08-06)
### Breaking changes:
- Removed `azure.core.Configuration` from the public API in preparation for a
revamped configuration API. Static `create_config` methods have been renamed
`_create_config`, and will be removed in a future release.
- This version of the library requires `azure-core` 1.0.0b2
  - If you later want to revert to a version requiring azure-core 1.0.0b1,
  of this or another Azure SDK library, you must explicitly install azure-core
  1.0.0b1 as well. For example:
  `pip install azure-core==1.0.0b1 azure-keyvault-secrets==4.0.0b1`

### New features:
- Distributed tracing framework OpenCensus is now supported
- Added support for HTTP challenge based authentication, allowing clients to
interact with vaults in sovereign clouds.

## 4.0.0b1 (2019-06-28)
Version 4.0.0b1 is the first preview of our efforts to create a user-friendly
and Pythonic client library for Azure Key Vault. For more information about
preview releases of other Azure SDK libraries, please visit
https://aka.ms/azure-sdk-preview1-python.

This library is not a direct replacement for `azure-keyvault`. Applications
using that library would require code changes to use `azure-keyvault-secrets`.
This package's
[documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-secrets/README.md)
and
[samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-secrets/samples)
demonstrate the new API.

### Major changes from `azure-keyvault`
- Packages scoped by functionality
    - `azure-keyvault-secrets` contains a client for secret operations,
    `azure-keyvault-keys` contains a client for key operations
- Client instances are scoped to vaults (an instance interacts with one vault
only)
- Asynchronous API supported on Python 3.5.3+
    - the `azure.keyvault.secrets.aio` namespace contains an async equivalent of
    the synchronous client in `azure.keyvault.secrets`
- Authentication using `azure-identity` credentials
  - see this package's
  [documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-secrets/README.md)
  , and the
  [Azure Identity documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/identity/azure-identity/README.md)
  for more information

### `azure-keyvault` features not implemented in this library
- Certificate management APIs
- National cloud support. This release supports public global cloud vaults,
    e.g. https://{vault-name}.vault.azure.net
