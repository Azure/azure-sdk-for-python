# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Prerequisites:
# 1. An Azure Key Vault (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/quick-create-cli)
#
# 2. azure-keyvault-keys and azure-identity libraries (pip install these)
#
# 3. Set environment variable VAULT_URL with the URL of your key vault
#
# 4. Set up your environment to use azure-identity's DefaultAzureCredential. To authenticate a service principal with
#    environment variables, set AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET, and AZURE_TENANT_ID
#    (See https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-keys#authenticate-the-client)
#
# 5. Key create, list, and delete permissions for your service principal in your vault
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Sample - demonstrates the basic list operations for keys
#
# 1. Create a key (create_key)
#
# 2. List keys from the Key Vault (list_keys)
#
# 3. List key versions from the Key Vault (list_properties_of_key_versions)
#
# 4. Delete keys (delete_key)
#
# 5. List deleted keys from the Key Vault (list_deleted_keys)
#
