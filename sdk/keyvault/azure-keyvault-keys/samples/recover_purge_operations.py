# Sample - demonstrates the basic recover and purge operations on a vault(key) resource for Azure Key Vault. The vault
# has to be soft-delete enabled to perform the following operations. See for more information about soft delete:
# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/key-vault-ovw-soft-delete
# 1. Create a key (create_key)
#
# 2. Delete a key (delete_key)
#
# 3. Recover a deleted key (recover_deleted_key)
#
# 4. Purge a deleted key (purge_deleted_key)
