# Azure Key Vault Keys client library for Python
Azure Key Vault allows you to create and store keys in the Key Vault. Azure Key Vault client supports RSA keys and elliptic curve keys, each with corresponding support in hardware security modules (HSM).

Multiple keys, and multiple versions of the same key, can be kept in the Key Vault. Cryptographic keys in Key Vault are represented as [JSON Web Key (JWK)][JWK] objects. This library offers operations to create, retrieve, update, delete, purge, backup, restore and list the keys and its versions.

## Getting started
### Install the package
Install the Azure Key Vault Keys client library for Python with [pip][pip]:

```Bash
pip install azure-keyvault-keys
```

### Prerequisites
* An [Azure subscription][azure_sub].
* Python 2.7, 3.5 or later to use this package.
* An existing Key Vault. If you need to create a Key Vault, you can use the [Azure Cloud Shell][azure_cloud_shell] to create one with this Azure CLI command. Replace `<your-resource-group-name>` and `<your-key-vault-name>` with your own, unique names:

    ```Bash
    az keyvault create --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> --name <your-key-vault-name>
    ```

### Authenticate the client
In order to interact with the Key Vault service, you'll need to create an instance of the [KeyClient][key_client_docs] class. You would need a **vault url** and **client secret credentials (client id, client secret, tenant id)** to instantiate a client object for using the `DefaultAzureCredential` examples in the README. `DefaultAzureCredential` authentication by providing client secret credentials is being used in this getting started section but you can find more ways to authenticate with [azure-identity][azure_identity].

 #### Create/Get credentials
Use the [Azure Cloud Shell][azure_cloud_shell] snippet below to create/get client secret credentials.

 * Create a service principal and configure its access to Azure resources:
    ```Bash
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n <your-application-name> --skip-assignment
    ```
    Output:
    ```json
    {
        "appId": "generated-app-ID",
        "displayName": "dummy-app-name",
        "name": "http://dummy-app-name",
        "password": "random-password",
        "tenant": "tenant-ID"
    }
    ```
* Use the credentials returned above to set **AZURE_CLIENT_ID**(appId), **AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET**(password) and **AZURE_TENANT_ID**(tenant) environment variables. The following example shows a way to do this in Bash:
  ```Bash
   export AZURE_CLIENT_ID="generated-app-ID"
   export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="random-password"
   export AZURE_TENANT_ID="tenant-ID"
  ```

* Grant the above mentioned application authorization to perform key operations on the keyvault:
    ```Bash
    az keyvault set-policy --name <your-key-vault-name> --spn $AZURE_CLIENT_ID --key-permissions backup delete get list create
    ```
    > --key-permissions:
    > Accepted values (management operations): backup, delete, get, list, purge, recover, restore, create, update, import
    > Accepted values (cryptographic operations): decrypt, encrypt, unwrapKey, wrapKey, verify, sign

* Use the above mentioned Key Vault name to retrieve details of your Vault which also contains your Key Vault URL:
    ```Bash
    az keyvault show --name <your-key-vault-name>
    ```

#### Create Key client
Once you've populated the **AZURE_CLIENT_ID**, **AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET** and **AZURE_TENANT_ID** environment variables and replaced **your-vault-url** with the above returned URI for example "<https://myvault.vault.azure.net>", you can create the [KeyClient][key_client_docs]:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.keys import KeyClient

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create a new Key client using the default credential
key_client = KeyClient(vault_url=<your-vault-url>, credential=credential)
```
## Key concepts
### Key
  Azure Key Vault supports multiple key types and algorithms, and enables the use of Hardware Security Modules
  (HSM) for high value keys. In addition to the key value, the following attributes may be specified:
* enabled: Specifies whether the key is enabled and useable for cryptographic operations.
* not_before: Identifies the time before which the key must not be used for cryptographic operations.
* expires: Identifies the expiration time on or after which the key MUST NOT be used for cryptographic operation.
* created: Indicates when this version of the key was created.
* updated: Indicates when this version of the key was updated.

### Key Client:
The Key client performs the interactions with the Azure Key Vault service for getting, setting, updating, deleting,and listing keys and its versions. An asynchronous and synchronous, KeyClient, client exists in the SDK allowing for selection of a client based on an application's use case. Once you've initialized a Key, you can interact with the primary resource types in Key Vault.

## Examples
The following section provides several code snippets using the above created `key_client`, covering some of the most common Azure Key Vault Key service related tasks, including:
* [Create a Key](#create-a-key)
* [Retrieve a Key](#retrieve-a-key)
* [Update an existing Key](#update-an-existing-key)
* [Delete a Key](#delete-a-key)
* [List Keys](#list-keys)
* [Asynchronously create a Key](#asynchronously-create-a-key)
* [Asynchronously list Keys](#asynchronously-list-keys)

### Create a Key
`create_rsa_key` and `create_ec_key` create RSA and elliptic curve keys in the vault, respectively.
If a key with the same name already exists, a new version of the key is created.

```python
# Create an RSA key
rsa_key = key_client.create_rsa_key("rsa-key-name", hsm=False, size=2048)
print(rsa_key.name)
print(rsa_key.key_material.kty)

# Create an elliptic curve key
ec_key = key_client.create_ec_key("ec-key-name", hsm=False, curve="P-256")
print(ec_key.name)
print(ec_key.key_material.kty)
```

### Retrieve a Key
`get_key` retrieves a key previously stored in the Key Vault.
```python
key = key_client.get_key("key-name")

print(key.name)
```

### Update an existing Key
`update_key` updates a key previously stored in the Key Vault.
```python
# Clients may specify additional application-specific metadata in the form of tags.
tags = {"foo": "updated tag"}

updated_key = key_client.update_key("key-name", tags=tags)

print(updated_key.name)
print(updated_key.version)
print(updated_key.updated)
print(updated_key.tags)
```

### Delete a Key
`delete_key` deletes a key previously stored in the Key Vault. When [soft-delete][soft_delete] is not enabled for the Key Vault, this operation permanently deletes the key.
```python
deleted_key = key_client.delete_key("key-name")

print(deleted_key.name)
print(deleted_key.deleted_date)
```
### List keys
This example lists all the keys in the specified Key Vault.
```python
keys = key_client.list_keys()

for key in keys:
    # the list doesn't include values or versions of the keys
    print(key.name)
```

### Cryptographic operations
`CryptographyClient` enables cryptographic operations (encrypt/decrypt,
wrap/unwrap, sign/verify) using a particular key.

```py
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.keys import KeyClient
from azure.keyvault.keys.crypto import EncryptionAlgorithm

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
key_client = KeyClient(vault_url=vault_url, credential=credential)

key = key_client.get_key("my-key")
crypto_client = key_client.get_cryptography_client(key)

result = crypto_client.encrypt(EncryptionAlgorithm.rsa_oaep, plaintext)
crypto_client.decrypt(result.algorithm, result.ciphertext)
```
See the [reference documentation][reference_docs] for more information.

### Async operations
This library includes a complete async API supported on Python 3.5+. To use it, you must
first install an async transport, such as [`aiohttp`](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/).
See
[azure-core documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/README.md#transport)
for more information.

### Asynchronously create a Key
`create_rsa_key` and `create_ec_key` create RSA and elliptic curve keys in the vault, respectively.
If a key with the same name already exists, a new version of the key is created.

```python
from azure.identity.aio import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.keys.aio import KeyClient

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
key_client = KeyClient(vault_url=vault_url, credential=credential)

# Create an RSA key
rsa_key = await key_client.create_rsa_key("rsa-key-name", hsm=False, size=2048)
print(rsa_key.name)
print(rsa_key.key_material.kty)

# Create an elliptic curve key
ec_key = await key_client.create_ec_key("ec-key-name", hsm=False, curve="P-256")
print(ec_key.name)
print(ec_key.key_material.kty)
```

### Asynchronously list keys
This example lists all the keys in the specified Key Vault.

```python
keys = key_client.list_keys()

async for key in keys:
    print(key.name)
```

## Troubleshooting
### General
Key Vault clients raise exceptions defined in azure-core. For more detailed infromation about exceptions and how to deal with them, see [Azure Core exceptions][azure_core_exceptions].

For example, if you try to retrieve a key after it is deleted a `404` error is returned, indicating resource not found. In the following snippet, the error is handled gracefully by catching the exception and displaying additional information about the error.
```python
from azure.core.exceptions import ResourceNotFoundError
try:
    key_client.get_key("deleted_key")
except ResourceNotFoundError as e:
    print(e.message)

Output: "Key not found:deleted_key"
```
### Logging
Network trace logging is disabled by default for this library. When enabled, this will be logged at DEBUG level. The logging policy is used to output the HTTP network trace to the configured logger. You can configure logging to print out debugging information to the stdout or write it to a file using the following example:

```python
import sys
import logging

# Create a logger for the 'azure' SDK
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Configure a console output
handler = logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout)
logger.addHandler(handler)

# Configure a file output
file_handler = logging.FileHandler(filename)
logger.addHandler(file_handler)

# Enable network trace logging. This will be logged at DEBUG level.
# By default, network tracing logging is disabled.
config = KeyClient.create_config(credential, logging_enable=True)
client = KeyClient(url, credential, config=config)
```
The logger can also be enabled per operation.

```python
key = key_client.get_key("key-name", logging_enable=True)
```
