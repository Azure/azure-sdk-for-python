"""
Comprehensive dead-letter queue example to show moving dead-lettered messages to a Service Bus
Queue, retrieving messages from it, and resubmitting corrected messages back into main queue asynchronously.

For an example of basic usage for receiving from a dead-letter queue asynchronously, please refer
to the sample `receive_deadlettered_messages_async.py`.
