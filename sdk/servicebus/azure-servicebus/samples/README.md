# Azure Service Bus client library for Python Samples

> **NOTE**: This document outlines the samples for the **preview** of the next version of the `azure-servicebus` package
> which has different APIs than the current version (0.50). Please visit [this link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/servicebus_v0.50.3/sdk/servicebus/azure-servicebus/samples) for samples of the existing library.

## Prerequisites
- Python 2.7, 3.5 or later.
- **Microsoft Azure Subscription:**  To use Azure services, including Azure Service Bus, you'll need a subscription.
If you do not have an existing Azure account, you may sign up for a free trial or use your MSDN subscriber benefits when you [create an account](https://account.windowsazure.com/Home/Index).

## Setup

1. Install the Azure Service Bus client library for Python with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):
```bash
pip install --pre azure-servicebus
```
2. Clone or download this sample repository.
3. Open the sample folder in Visual Studio Code or your IDE of choice.

## Running the samples

1. Open a terminal window and `cd` to the directory that the samples are saved in.
2. Set the environment variables specified in the sample file you wish to run.
3. Follow the usage described in the file, e.g. `python send_queue.py`.

## Next steps

Check out the [API reference documentation](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/python/azure-servicebus/latest/index.html) to learn more about
what you can do with the Azure Service Bus client library.
