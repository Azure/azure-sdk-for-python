# Guide to migrate from azure-servicebus v0.50 to v7

This document is intended for users that are familiar with v0.50 of the Python SDK for Service Bus library (`azure-servicebus 0.50.x`) and wish 
to migrate their application to v7 of the same library.

For users new to the Python SDK for Service Bus, please see the [readme file for the azure-servicebus](./README.md).

## General changes
Version 7 of the azure-servicebus package is the result of our efforts to create a client library that is user-friendly and idiomatic to the Python ecosystem.
Alongside an API redesign driven by the new [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Python](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python_introduction.html#design-principles), 
the latest version improves on several areas from v0.50.

Note: The large version gap is in order to normalize service bus SDK versions across our languages, as they consolidate on structure as well.

### Specific clients for sending and receiving
In v7 we've simplified the API surface, making two distinct clients, rather than one for each of queue, topic, and subscription:
* `ServiceBusSender` for sending messages. [Sync API](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/python/azure-servicebus/7.0.0b1/azure.servicebus.html#azure.servicebus.ServiceBusSender)
and [Async API](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/python/azure-servicebus/7.0.0b1/azure.servicebus.aio.html#azure.servicebus.aio.ServiceBusSender)
* `ServiceBusReceiver` for receiving messages. [Sync API](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/python/azure-servicebus/7.0.0b1/azure.servicebus.html#azure.servicebus.ServiceBusReceiver)
and [Async API](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/python/azure-servicebus/7.0.0b1/azure.servicebus.aio.html#azure.servicebus.aio.ServiceBusReceiver)
* `ServiceBusSessionReceiver` for receiving messages from a session. [Sync API](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/python/azure-servicebus/7.0.0b1/azure.servicebus.html#azure.servicebus.ServiceBusSessionReceiver)
and [Async API](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/python/azure-servicebus/7.0.0b1/azure.servicebus.aio.html#azure.servicebus.aio.ServiceBusSessionReceiver)

As a user this will be largely transparent to you, as initialization will still occur primarily via the top level ServiceBusClient,
the primary difference will be that rather than creating a queue_client, for instance, and then a sender off of that, you would simply
create a servicebus queue sender off of your ServiceBusClient instance via the "get_queue_sender" method.

It should also be noted that many of the helper methods that previously existed on the intermediary client (e.g. QueueClient and Peek) now
exist on the receiver (in the case of peek) or sender itself.  This is to better consolidate functionality and align messaging link lifetime
semantics with the sender or receiver lifetime.

* [Sending messages](#migrating-code-from-queueclient-and-sender-to-servicebussender-for-sending-messages)

### Migrating code from `QueueClient` and `Receiver` to `ServiceBusReceiver` for receiving messages

In v0.50, `QueueClient` would be created directly or from the `ServiceBusClient.get_queue` method,
after which user would call `get_receiver` to obtain a receiver, calling `fetch_next` to receive a single 
batch of messages, or iterate over the receiver to receive continuously.

In v7, users should initialize the client via `ServiceBusClient.get_queue_receiver`.  Single-batch-receive
has been renamed to `receive`, iterating over the receiver for continual message consumption has not changed.
It should also be noted that if a session receiver is desired, to use the `get_<queue/subscription>_session_receiver`
function.

For example, this code which keeps receiving from a partition in v0.50:

```python
client = ServiceBusClient.from_connection_string(CONNECTION_STR)
queue_client = client.get_queue(queue)

with queue_client.get_receiver(idle_timeout=1, mode=ReceiveSettleMode.PeekLock, prefetch=10) as receiver:

    # Receive list of messages as a batch
    batch = receiver.fetch_next(max_batch_size=10)
    for message in batch:
        print("Message: {}".format(message))
        message.complete()

    # Receive messages as a continuous generator
    for message in receiver:
        print("Message: {}".format(message))
        message.complete()
```

Becomes this in v7:
```python
with ServiceBusClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=CONNECTION_STR) as client:

    with client.get_queue_receiver(queue_name=QUEUE_NAME) as receiver:
        batch = receiver.receive(max_batch_size=10, max_wait_time=5)
        for message in batch:
            print("Message: {}".format(message))
            message.complete()

        for message in receiver:
            print("Message: {}".format(message))
            message.complete()
```


### Migrating code from `QueueClient` and `Sender` to `ServiceBusSender` for sending messages

In v0.50, `QueueClient` would be created directly or from the `ServiceBusClient.get_queue` method,
after which user would call `get_sender` to obtain a sender, calling `send` to send a single or batch
of messages.  Send could also be called directly off of the `QueueClient`

In v7, users should initialize the client via `ServiceBusClient.get_queue_sender`.  Sending itself has not
changed, but currently does not support sending a list of messages in one call.  If this is desired, first
insert those messages into a batch.

So in v0.50:
```python
client = ServiceBusClient.from_connection_string(CONNECTION_STR)

queue_client = client.get_queue(queue)
with queue_client.get_sender() as sender:
    # Send one at a time.
    for i in range(100):
        message = Message("Sample message no. {}".format(i))
        sender.send(message)

    # Send as a batch.
    messages_to_batch = [Message("Batch message no. {}".format(i)) for i in range(10)]
    batch = BatchMessage(messages_to_batch)
    sender.send(batch)
```

In v7:
```python
with ServiceBusClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=CONNECTION_STR) as client:

    with client.get_queue_sender(queue_name=QUEUE_NAME) as sender:
        # Sending one at a time.
        for i in range(100):
            message = Message("Sample message no. {}".format(i))
            sender.send(message)

        # Send as a batch
        batch = new BatchMessage()
        for i in range(10):
            batch.add(Message("Batch message no. {}".format(i)))
        sender.send(batch)
```
