     disposition to determine whether the error should be retryable.
    :paramtype retry_policy: ~pyamqp.error.RetryPolicy
    :keyword keep_alive_interval: If set, a thread will be started to keep the connection
     alive during periods of user inactivity. The value will determine how long the

     thread will be started.
    :paramtype keep_alive_interval: int
    :keyword max_frame_size: Maximum AMQP frame size. Default is 63488 bytes.
    :paramtype max_frame_size: int

     ~pyamqp.endpoint.Source, ~pyamqp.endpoint.Target, dict, ~pyamqp.error.AMQPConnectionError]
    :keyword send_settle_mode: The mode by which to settle message send
     operations. If set to `Unsettled`, the client will wait for a confirmation
     from the service that the message was successfully sent. If set to 'Settled',
     the client will not wait for confirmation and assume success.
    :paramtype send_settle_mode: ~pyamqp.constants.SenderSettleMode
    :keyword receive_settle_mode: The mode by which to settle message receive
     operations. If set to `PeekLock`, the receiver will lock a message once received until
     the client accepts or rejects the message. If set to `ReceiveAndDelete`, the service

     default is `PeekLock`.

     The default is 300.
    :paramtype link_credit: int
    :keyword transport_type: The type of transport protocol that will be used for communicating with
     the service. Default is `TransportType.Amqp` in which case port 5671 is used.
     If the port 5671 is unavailable/blocked in the network environment, `TransportType.AmqpOverWebsocket` could
     be used instead which uses port 443 for communication.
    :paramtype transport_type: ~pyamqp.constants.TransportType
    :keyword http_proxy: HTTP proxy settings. This must be a dictionary with the following
     keys: `'proxy_hostname'` (str value) and `'proxy_port'` (int value).
     Additionally the following keys may also be present: `'username', 'password'`.
    :paramtype http_proxy: dict[str, str]
    :keyword custom_endpoint_address: The custom endpoint address to use for establishing a connection to
     the Event Hubs service, allowing network requests to be routed through any application gateways or
     other paths needed for the host environment. Default is None.
     If port is not specified in the `custom_endpoint_address`, by default port 443 will be used.
    :paramtype custom_endpoint_address: str
    :keyword connection_verify: Path to the custom CA_BUNDLE file of the SSL certificate which is used to
     authenticate the identity of the connection endpoint.
