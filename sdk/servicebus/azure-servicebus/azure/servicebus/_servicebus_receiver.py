    """The ServiceBusReceiver class defines a high level interface for
    receiving messages from the Azure Service Bus Queue or Topic Subscription.

     The namespace format is: `<yournamespace>.servicebus.windows.net`.
    :vartype fully_qualified_namespace: str
    :ivar entity_path: The path of the entity that the client connects to.

     The namespace format is: `<yournamespace>.servicebus.windows.net`.
    :param ~azure.core.credentials.TokenCredential credential: The credential object used for authentication which
     implements a particular interface for getting tokens. It accepts
     :class:`ServiceBusSharedKeyCredential<azure.servicebus.ServiceBusSharedKeyCredential>`, or credential objects
     generated by the azure-identity library and objects that implement the `get_token(self, *scopes)` method.
    :keyword str queue_name: The path of specific Service Bus Queue the client connects to.
    :keyword str topic_name: The path of specific Service Bus Topic which contains the Subscription
     the client connects to.
    :keyword str subscription_name: The path of specific Service Bus Subscription under the
     specified Topic the client connects to.
    :keyword int prefetch: The maximum number of messages to cache with each request to the service.
     The default value is 0, meaning messages will be received from the service and processed
     one at a time. Increasing this value will improve message throughput performance but increase
     the change that messages will expire while they are cached if they're not processed fast enough.
    :keyword float idle_timeout: The timeout in seconds between received messages after which the receiver will
     automatically shutdown. The default value is 0, meaning no timeout.
    :keyword mode: The mode with which messages will be retrieved from the entity. The two options
     are PeekLock and ReceiveAndDelete. Messages received with PeekLock must be settled within a given
     lock period before they will be removed from the queue. Messages received with ReceiveAndDelete
     will be immediately removed from the queue, and cannot be subsequently rejected or re-received if
     the client fails to process the message. The default mode is PeekLock.
    :paramtype mode: ~azure.servicebus.ReceiveSettleMode
    :keyword bool logging_enable: Whether to output network trace logs to the logger. Default is `False`.
    :keyword int retry_total: The total number of attempts to redo a failed operation when an error occurs.
     Default value is 3.
    :keyword transport_type: The type of transport protocol that will be used for communicating with
     the Service Bus service. Default is `TransportType.Amqp`.
    :paramtype transport_type: ~azure.servicebus.TransportType
    :keyword dict http_proxy: HTTP proxy settings. This must be a dictionary with the following
     keys: `'proxy_hostname'` (str value) and `'proxy_port'` (int value).
     Additionally the following keys may also be present: `'username', 'password'`.
