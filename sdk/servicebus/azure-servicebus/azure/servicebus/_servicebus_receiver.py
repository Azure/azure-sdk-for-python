    """The ServiceBusReceiver class defines a high level interface for
    receiving messages from the Azure Service Bus Queue or Topic Subscription.

    The two primary channels for message receipt are `receive()` to make a single request for messages,
    and `for message in receiver:` to continuously receive incoming messages in an ongoing fashion.

    **Please use the `get_<queue/subscription>_receiver` method of ~azure.servicebus.ServiceBusClient to create a
    ServiceBusReceiver instance.**

    :ivar fully_qualified_namespace: The fully qualified host name for the Service Bus namespace.
     The namespace format is: `<yournamespace>.servicebus.windows.net`.
    :vartype fully_qualified_namespace: str
    :ivar entity_path: The path of the entity that the client connects to.
    :vartype entity_path: str

    :param str fully_qualified_namespace: The fully qualified host name for the Service Bus namespace.
     The namespace format is: `<yournamespace>.servicebus.windows.net`.
    :param credential: The credential object used for authentication which
     implements a particular interface for getting tokens. It accepts
     credential objects generated by the azure-identity library and objects that implement the
     `get_token(self, *scopes)` method, or alternatively, an AzureSasCredential can be provided too.
    :type credential: ~azure.core.credentials.TokenCredential or ~azure.core.credentials.AzureSasCredential
     or ~azure.core.credentials.AzureNamedKeyCredential
    :keyword str queue_name: The path of specific Service Bus Queue the client connects to.
    :keyword str topic_name: The path of specific Service Bus Topic which contains the Subscription
     the client connects to.
    :keyword str subscription_name: The path of specific Service Bus Subscription under the
     specified Topic the client connects to.
    :keyword Optional[float] max_wait_time: The timeout in seconds between received messages after which the
     receiver will automatically stop receiving. The default value is None, meaning no timeout.
    :keyword receive_mode: The mode with which messages will be retrieved from the entity. The two options
     are PEEK_LOCK and RECEIVE_AND_DELETE. Messages received with PEEK_LOCK must be settled within a given
     lock period before they will be removed from the queue. Messages received with RECEIVE_AND_DELETE
     will be immediately removed from the queue, and cannot be subsequently abandoned or re-received
     if the client fails to process the message.
     The default mode is PEEK_LOCK.
    :paramtype receive_mode: Union[~azure.servicebus.ServiceBusReceiveMode, str]
    :keyword bool logging_enable: Whether to output network trace logs to the logger. Default is `False`.
    :keyword transport_type: The type of transport protocol that will be used for communicating with
     the Service Bus service. Default is `TransportType.Amqp`.
    :paramtype transport_type: ~azure.servicebus.TransportType
    :keyword Dict http_proxy: HTTP proxy settings. This must be a dictionary with the following
     keys: `'proxy_hostname'` (str value) and `'proxy_port'` (int value).
     Additionally the following keys may also be present: `'username', 'password'`.
    :keyword str user_agent: If specified, this will be added in front of the built-in user agent string.
    :keyword Optional[~azure.servicebus.AutoLockRenewer] auto_lock_renewer: An ~azure.servicebus.AutoLockRenewer
     can be provided such that messages are automatically registered on receipt. If the receiver is a session
     receiver, it will apply to the session instead.
    :keyword int prefetch_count: The maximum number of messages to cache with each request to the service.
     This setting is only for advanced performance tuning. Increasing this value will improve message throughput
     performance but increase the chance that messages will expire while they are cached if they're not
     processed fast enough.
     The default value is 0, meaning messages will be received from the service and processed one at a time.
     In the case of prefetch_count being 0, `ServiceBusReceiver.receive` would try to cache `max_message_count`
     (if provided) within its request to the service.
