    """The ServiceBusSessionReceiver class defines a high level interface for
    receiving messages from the Azure Service Bus Queue or Topic Subscription
    while utilizing a session for FIFO and ownership semantics.

    The two primary channels for message receipt are `receive()` to make a single request for messages,
    and `for message in receiver:` to continuously receive incoming messages in an ongoing fashion.

    :ivar fully_qualified_namespace: The fully qualified host name for the Service Bus namespace.
     The namespace format is: `<yournamespace>.servicebus.windows.net`.
    :vartype fully_qualified_namespace: str
    :ivar entity_path: The path of the entity that the client connects to.
    :vartype entity_path: str

    :param str fully_qualified_namespace: The fully qualified host name for the Service Bus namespace.
     The namespace format is: `<yournamespace>.servicebus.windows.net`.
    :param ~azure.core.credentials.TokenCredential credential: The credential object used for authentication which
     implements a particular interface for getting tokens. It accepts
     :class:`ServiceBusSharedKeyCredential<azure.servicebus.ServiceBusSharedKeyCredential>`, or credential objects
     generated by the azure-identity library and objects that implement the `get_token(self, *scopes)` method.
    :keyword str queue_name: The path of specific Service Bus Queue the client connects to.
    :keyword str topic_name: The path of specific Service Bus Topic which contains the Subscription
     the client connects to.
    :keyword str subscription_name: The path of specific Service Bus Subscription under the
     specified Topic the client connects to.
    :keyword float max_wait_time: The timeout in seconds between received messages after which the receiver will
     automatically shutdown. The default value is 0, meaning no timeout.
    :keyword mode: The mode with which messages will be retrieved from the entity. The two options
     are PeekLock and ReceiveAndDelete. Messages received with PeekLock must be settled within a given
     lock period before they will be removed from the queue. Messages received with ReceiveAndDelete
     will be immediately removed from the queue, and cannot be subsequently abandoned or re-received
     if the client fails to process the message.
     The default mode is PeekLock.
    :paramtype mode: ~azure.servicebus.ReceiveSettleMode
    :keyword session_id: A specific session from which to receive. This must be specified for a
     sessionful entity, otherwise it must be None. In order to receive messages from the next available
     session, set this to None.  The default is None.
    :paramtype session_id: str
    :keyword bool logging_enable: Whether to output network trace logs to the logger. Default is `False`.
    :keyword int retry_total: The total number of attempts to redo a failed operation when an error occurs.
     Default value is 3.
    :keyword transport_type: The type of transport protocol that will be used for communicating with
     the Service Bus service. Default is `TransportType.Amqp`.
    :paramtype transport_type: ~azure.servicebus.TransportType
    :keyword dict http_proxy: HTTP proxy settings. This must be a dictionary with the following
     keys: `'proxy_hostname'` (str value) and `'proxy_port'` (int value).
     Additionally the following keys may also be present: `'username', 'password'`.
    :keyword str user_agent: If specified, this will be added in front of the built-in user agent string.
    :keyword int prefetch: The maximum number of messages to cache with each request to the service.
     This setting is only for advanced performance tuning. Increasing this value will improve message throughput
     performance but increase the chance that messages will expire while they are cached if they're not
     processed fast enough.
     The default value is 0, meaning messages will be received from the service and processed one at a time.
     In the case of prefetch being 0, `ServiceBusReceiver.receive` would try to cache `max_batch_size` (if provided)
     within its request to the service.
