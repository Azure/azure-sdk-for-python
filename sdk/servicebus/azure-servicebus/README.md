# Azure Service Bus client library for Python

Azure Service Bus is a high performance cloud-managed messaging service for providing real-time and fault-tolerant communication between distributed senders and receivers.

Service Bus provides multiple mechanisms for asynchronous highly reliable communication, such as structured first-in-first-out messaging, 
publish/subscribe capabilities, and the ability to easily scale as your needs grow.

Use the Service Bus client library for Python to communicate between applications and services and implement asynchronous messaging patterns.

* Create Service Bus namespaces, queues, topics, and subscriptions, and modify their settings
* Send and receive messages within your Service Bus channels.
* Utilize message locks, sessions, and dead letter functionality to implement complex messaging patterns.

Note: This is a preview release of the Python Service Bus SDK, and is not yet at feature parity with version 0.50.  Some functionality, such as topic and subscription utilization, will be arriving in upcoming Preview releases; Thank you for your patience and interest as we roll out these changes.

## Getting started

### Install the package

Install the Azure Service Bus client library for Python with [pip][pip]:

```Bash
pip install azure-servicebus --pre
```

### Prerequisites: 
To use this package, you must have:
* Azure subscription - [Create a free account][azure_sub]
* Azure Service Bus - [Namespace and management credentials][service_bus_namespace]
* Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8 - [Install Python][python]


If you need an Azure service bus namespace, you can create it via the [Azure Portal][azure_namespace_creation].
If you do not wish to use the graphical portal UI, you can use the Azure CLI via [Cloud Shell][cloud_shell_bash], or Azure CLI run locally, to create one with this Azure CLI command:

```Bash
az servicebus namespace create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <servicebus-namespace-name> --location <servicebus-namespace-location>
```

### Authenticate the client

Interaction with Service Bus starts with an instance of the `ServiceBusClient` class. You either need a **connection string with SAS key**, or a **namespace** and one of its **account keys** to instantiate the client object.

#### Get credentials

Use the [Azure CLI][azure_cli] snippet below to populate an environment variable with the service bus connection string (you can also find these values in the [Azure portal][azure_portal]. The snippet is formatted for the Bash shell.

```Bash
RES_GROUP=<resource-group-name>
NAMESPACE_NAME=<servicebus-namespace-name>

export SERVICE_BUS_CONN_STR=$(az servicebus namespace authorization-rule keys list --resource-group $RES_GROUP --namespace-name $NAMESPACE_NAME --query RootManageSharedAccessKey --output tsv)
```

#### Create client

Once you've populated the `SERVICE_BUS_CONN_STR` environment variable, you can create the `ServiceBusClient`.

```Python
from azure.servicebus import ServiceBusClient

import os
connstr = os.environ['SERVICE_BUS_CONN_STR']

with ServiceBusClient.from_connection_string(connstr) as client:
    ...
```

Note: client can be initialized without a context manager, but must be manually closed via client.close() to not leak resources.

## Key concepts

Once you've initialized a `ServiceBusClient`, you can interact with the primary resource types within a Service Bus Namespace, of which multiple can exist and on which actual message transmission takes place, the namespace often serving as an application container:

* [Queue][queue_concept]: Allows for Sending and Receiving of messages, ordered first-in-first-out.  Often used for point-to-point communication.

* [Topic][topic_concept]: As opposed to Queues, Topics are better suited to publish/subscribe scenarios.  A topic can be sent to, but requires a subscription, of which there can be multiple in parallel, to consume from.

* [Subscription][subscription_concept]: The mechanism to consume from a Topic.  Each subscription is independent, and receives a copy of each message sent to the topic.  Rules and Filters can be used to tailor which messages are received by a specific subscription.

For more information about these resources, see [What is Azure Service Bus?][service_bus_overview].

To interact with these resources, one should be familiar with the following SDK concepts:

* [ServiceBusClient](./azure/servicebus/_servicebus_client.py): This is the object a user should first initialize to connect to a Service Bus Namespace.  To interact with a queue, topic, or subscription, one would spawn a sender or receiver off of this client.

* [Sender](./azure/servicebus/_servicebus_sender.py): To send messages to a Queue or Topic, one would use the corresponding `get_queue_sender` or `get_topic_sender` method off of a `ServiceBusClient` instance as seen [here](./samples/sync_samples/send_queue.py).

* [Receiver](./azure/servicebus/_servicebus_receiver.py): To receive messages from a Queue or Subscription, one would use the corrosponding `get_queue_receiver` or `get_subscription_receiver` method off of a `ServiceBusClient` instance as seen [here](./samples/sync_samples/receive_queue.py).

* [Message](./azure/servicebus/_common/message.py): When sending, this is the type you will construct to contain your payload.  When receiving, this is where you will access the payload and control how the message is "settled" (completed, dead-lettered, etc); these functions are only available on a received message.

## Examples

The following sections provide several code snippets covering some of the most common Service Bus tasks, including:

* [Send a message to a queue](#send-to-a-queue)
* [Receive a message from a queue](#receive-from-a-queue)
* [Defer a message on receipt](#defer-a-message)

To perform management tasks such as creating and deleting queues/topics/subscriptions, please utilize the azure-mgmt-servicebus library, available [here][servicebus_management_repository].


### Send to a queue

This example sends a message to a queue that is assumed to already exist, created via the Azure portal or az commands.

```Python
from azure.servicebus import ServiceBusClient, Message

import os
connstr = os.environ['SERVICE_BUS_CONN_STR']
queue_name = os.environ['SERVICE_BUS_QUEUE_NAME']

with ServiceBusClient.from_connection_string(connstr) as client:
    with client.get_queue_sender(queue_name) as sender:

        message = Message("Single message")
        sender.send(message)
```

### Receive from a queue

To receive from a queue, you can either perform a one-off receive via "receiver.receive()" or receive persistently as follows:

```Python
from azure.servicebus import ServiceBusClient

import os
connstr = os.environ['SERVICE_BUS_CONN_STR']
queue_name = os.environ['SERVICE_BUS_QUEUE_NAME']

with ServiceBusClient.from_connection_string(connstr) as client:
    with client.get_queue_receiver(queue_name) as receiver:
        for msg in receiver:
            print(str(msg))
            msg.complete()
```

### Defer a message

When receiving from a queue, you have multiple actions you can take on the messages you receive.  Where the prior example completes a message,
permanently removing it from the queue and marking as complete, this example demonstrates how to defer the message, sending it back to the queue
such that it must now be received via sequence number:

```Python
from azure.servicebus import ServiceBusClient

import os
connstr = os.environ['SERVICE_BUS_CONN_STR']

with ServiceBusClient.from_connection_string(connstr) as client:
    with client.get_queue_receiver(queue_name) as receiver:
        for msg in receiver:
            print(str(msg))
            msg.defer()
```

## Troubleshooting

### Logging

- Enable `azure.servicebus` logger to collect traces from the library.
- Enable `uamqp` logger to collect traces from the underlying uAMQP library.
- Enable AMQP frame level trace by setting `logging_enable=True` when creating the client.

### Timeouts

There are various timeouts a user should be aware of within the library.
- 10 minute service side link closure:  A link, once opened, will be closed after 10 minutes idle to protect the service against resource leakage.  This should largely
be transparent to a user, but if you notice a reconnect occuring after such a duration, this is why.  Performing any operations, including management operations, on the
link will extend this timeout.
- idle_timeout: Provided on creation of a receiver, the time after which the underlying UAMQP link will be closed after no traffic.  This primarily dictates the length
a generator-style receive will run for before exiting if there are no messages.  Passing None (default) will wait forever, up until the 10 minute threshold if no other action is taken.
- max_wait_time: Provided when calling receive() to fetch a batch of messages.  Dictates how long the receive() will wait for more messages before returning, similarly up to the aformentioned limits.

### Common Exceptions
