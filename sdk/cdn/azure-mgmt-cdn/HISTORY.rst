Release History
===============

4.1.0rc1 (2020-01-18)
+++++++++++++++++++++

**Features**

- Model Endpoint has a new parameter web_application_firewall_policy_link
- Model EndpointUpdateParameters has a new parameter web_application_firewall_policy_link
- Added operation group PoliciesOperations
- Added operation group ManagedRuleSetsOperations

4.0.0 (2019-11-25)
++++++++++++++++++

**Features**

- Model DeliveryRule has a new parameter name
- Model CdnManagedHttpsParameters has a new parameter minimum_tls_version
- Model UserManagedHttpsParameters has a new parameter minimum_tls_version
- Model CustomDomainHttpsParameters has a new parameter minimum_tls_version
- Model CustomDomain has a new parameter custom_https_parameters
- Added operation group CdnManagementClientOperationsMixin

**General Breaking Changes**

This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might* introduce breaking changes.
In summary, some modules were incorrectly visible/importable and have been renamed. This fixed several issues caused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be used in the first place.

- CdnManagementClient cannot be imported from `azure.mgmt.cdn.cdn_management_client` anymore (import from `azure.mgmt.cdn` works like before)
- CdnManagementClientConfiguration import has been moved from `azure.mgmt.cdn.cdn_management_client` to `azure.mgmt.cdn`
- A model `MyClass` from a "models" sub-module cannot be imported anymore using `azure.mgmt.cdn.models.my_class` (import from `azure.mgmt.cdn.models` works like before)
- An operation class `MyClassOperations` from an `operations` sub-module cannot be imported anymore using `azure.mgmt.cdn.operations.my_class_operations` (import from `azure.mgmt.cdn.operations` works like before)

Last but not least, HTTP connection pooling is now enabled by default. You should always use a client as a context manager, or call close(), or use no more than one client per process.

3.1.0 (2019-03-05)
++++++++++++++++++

**Features**

- Add custom_domain_https_parameters support

3.0.0 (2018-05-25)
++++++++++++++++++

**Features**

- Add client method check_name_availability_with_subscription
- Model EndpointUpdateParameters has a new parameter delivery_policy
- Model Endpoint has a new parameter delivery_policy
- Client class can be used as a context manager to keep the underlying HTTP session open for performance

**General Breaking changes**

This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might* introduce breaking changes.

- Model signatures now use only keyword-argument syntax. All positional arguments must be re-written as keyword-arguments.
  To keep auto-completion in most cases, models are now generated for Python 2 and Python 3. Python 3 uses the "*" syntax for keyword-only arguments.
- Enum types now use the "str" mixin (class AzureEnum(str, Enum)) to improve the behavior when unrecognized enum values are encountered.
  While this is not a breaking change, the distinctions are important, and are documented here:
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#others
  At a glance:

  - "is" should not be used at all.
  - "format" will return the string value, where "%s" string formatting will return `NameOfEnum.stringvalue`. Format syntax should be prefered.

- New Long Running Operation:

  - Return type changes from `msrestazure.azure_operation.AzureOperationPoller` to `msrest.polling.LROPoller`. External API is the same.
  - Return type is now **always** a `msrest.polling.LROPoller`, regardless of the optional parameters used.
  - The behavior has changed when using `raw=True`. Instead of returning the initial call result as `ClientRawResponse`,
    without polling, now this returns an LROPoller. After polling, the final resource will be returned as a `ClientRawResponse`.
  - New `polling` parameter. The default behavior is `Polling=True` which will poll using ARM algorithm. When `Polling=False`,
    the response of the initial call will be returned without polling.
  - `polling` parameter accepts instances of subclasses of `msrest.polling.PollingMethod`.
  - `add_done_callback` will no longer raise if called after polling is finished, but will instead execute the callback right away.
