    Receipt represents the object contained in the `receipt` field of an Azure Confidential Ledger write transaction receipt response paylaod.
    A receipt is a cryptographic proof that a transaction has been committed to the ledger: it can be used to verify that the ledger entry associated
    to a transaction has been appended to the ledger (thus, it can be used to validate properties such as non-repudiation, integrity, and tamper-proofing).
    A receipt contains all the information needed to verify transaction inclusion and the verification can be done by applying an ad-hoc algorithm.
