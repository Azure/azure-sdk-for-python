FILE: get_receipt_async.py
DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates how to retrieve Confidential Ledger receipts. In this sample, we write
    a ledger entry and retrieve a receipt certifying that it was written correctly. 
USAGE:
    python get_receipt_async.py
    Set the environment variables with your own values before running the sample:
    1) CONFIDENTIALLEDGER_ENDPOINT - the endpoint of the Confidential Ledger.
