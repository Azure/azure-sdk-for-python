# Azure Confidential Ledger Certificate client library for Python

The Confidential Ledger Certificate client library is used to retrieve the TLS certificate required for connecting to a Confidential Ledger.

## Getting started

### Install the package

```bash
python -m pip install azure-confidentialledger-certificate
```

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or later is required to use this package.
- You need an [Azure subscription][azure_sub] to use this package.
- An existing Confidential Ledger instance.

## Key concepts

Clients may authenticate with a client certificate in mutual TLS instead of via an Azure Active Directory token. Use the `get_ledger_identity()` method on the `ConfidentialLedgerCertificateClient` to retrieve the certificate.

## Examples

Get a ledger certificate for authentication using the `ConfidentialLedgerCertificateClient` from the `azure-confidentialledger-certificate` package, save the certificate, pass the certificate path to the `ConfidentialLedgerCertificateCredential` from the `azure-confidentialledger` package, and pass the credential to the `ConfidentialLedgerClient` for authentication:

```python
from azure.confidentialledger.certificate import ConfidentialLedgerCertificateClient
from azure.confidentialledger import (
    ConfidentialLedgerCertificateCredential,
    ConfidentialLedgerClient,
)

identity_client = ConfidentialLedgerCertificateClient()
network_identity = identity_client.get_ledger_identity(
    ledger_id="my-ledger-id"
)

ledger_tls_cert_file_name = "ledger_certificate.pem"
with open(ledger_tls_cert_file_name, "w") as cert_file:
    cert_file.write(network_identity["ledgerTlsCertificate"])

credential = ConfidentialLedgerCertificateCredential(
    certificate_path="Path to user certificate PEM file"
)
ledger_client = ConfidentialLedgerClient(
    endpoint="https://my-ledger-id.confidential-ledger.azure.com",
    credential=credential,
    ledger_certificate_path=ledger_tls_cert_file_name
)
```

## Troubleshooting

Confidential Ledger clients raise exceptions defined in [azure-core][azure_core_exceptions].

## Next steps

Use the certificate retrieved using this library with the `azure-confidentialledger` package. The Azure Confidential Ledger client library has several code samples that show common scenario operations.
