# Per advice from Azure SDK team, suppress the assignment error in _models.py. This file was auto-generated from TypeSpec files, and produces these MyPy errors:

# Note that we also have the line `# mypy: disable-error-code="attr-defined"` at the top of every sample code file
# under the "samples" folder. This is to suppress the MyPy error "ImageAnalysisClient has no attribute analyze  [attr-defined]".
