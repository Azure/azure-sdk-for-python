DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates how to extract printed or hand-written text for the image file sample.jpg
    using a synchronous client.

    The synchronous (blocking) `analyze` method call returns an `ImageAnalysisResult` object.
    Its `read` property (a `ReadResult` object) includes a list of `TextBlock` objects. Currently, the
    list will always contain one element only, as the service does not yet support grouping text lines
    into separate blocks. The `TextBlock` object contains a list of `DocumentLine` object. Each one includes: 
    - The text content of the line.
    - A `BoundingPolygon` coordinates in pixels, for a polygon surrounding the line of text in the image.
    - A list of `DocumentWord` objects.
    Each `DocumentWord` object contains:
    - The text content of the word.
    - A `BoundingPolygon` coordinates in pixels, for a polygon surrounding the word in the image.
    - A confidence score in the range [0, 1], with higher values indicating greater confidences in
      the recognition of the word. 

USAGE:
    python sample_ocr_image_file.py

    Set these two environment variables before running the sample:
    1) VISION_ENDPOINT - Your endpoint URL, in the form https://your-resource-name.cognitiveservices.azure.com
                         where `your-resource-name` is your unique Azure Computer Vision resource name.
    2) VISION_KEY - Your Computer Vision key (a 32-character Hexadecimal number)
