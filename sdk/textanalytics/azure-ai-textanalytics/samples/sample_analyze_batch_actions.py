DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates how to submit a collection of text documents for analysis, which consists of a variety
    of text analysis actions, such as Entity Recognition, PII Entity Recognition,
    or Key Phrase Extraction.  The response will contain results from each of the individual actions specified in the request.

USAGE:
    python sample_analyze_batch_actions.py

    Set the environment variables with your own values before running the sample:
    1) AZURE_TEXT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT - the endpoint to your Cognitive Services resource.
    2) AZURE_TEXT_ANALYTICS_KEY - your Text Analytics subscription key

            They provide marvelous food and they have a great menu. The chief cook happens to be the owner (I think his name is John Doe) \
            and he is super nice, coming out of the kitchen and greeted us all. We enjoyed very much dining in the place! \
            The Sirloin steak I ordered was tender and juicy, and the place was impeccably clean. You can even pre-order from their \
            online menu at www.contososteakhouse.com, call 312-555-0176 or send email to order@contososteakhouse.com! \
            The only complaint I have is the food didn't come fast enough. Overall I highly recommend it!"
