FILE: sample_multi_category_classify_async.py

DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates how to classify documents into multiple custom categories. Here we have a few
    movie plot summaries that must be categorized into movie genres like Sci-Fi, Horror, Comedy, Romance, etc.
    Classifying documents is available as an action type through the begin_analyze_actions API.

    To train a model to classify your documents, see https://aka.ms/azsdk/textanalytics/customfunctionalities

USAGE:
    python sample_multi_category_classify_async.py

    Set the environment variables with your own values before running the sample:
    1) AZURE_TEXT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT - the endpoint to your Cognitive Services resource.
    2) AZURE_TEXT_ANALYTICS_KEY - your Text Analytics subscription key
    3) MULTI_CATEGORY_CLASSIFY_PROJECT_NAME - your Text Analytics Language Studio project name
    4) MULTI_CATEGORY_CLASSIFY_DEPLOYMENT_NAME - your Text Analytics deployed model name
