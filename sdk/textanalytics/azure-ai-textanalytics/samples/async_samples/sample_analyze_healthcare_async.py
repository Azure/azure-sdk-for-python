FILE: sample_analyze_healthcare_async.py

DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates how to detect healthcare entities in a batch of documents.
    Each entity found in the document will have a link associated with it from a
    data source.  Relations between entities will also be included in the response.

USAGE:
    python sample_analyze_healthcare_async.py

    Set the environment variables with your own values before running the sample:
    1) AZURE_TEXT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT - the endpoint to your Cognitive Services resource.
    2) AZURE_TEXT_ANALYTICS_KEY - your Text Analytics subscription key

            The patient is a 54-year-old gentleman with a history of progressive angina over the past several months. \
            The patient had a cardiac catheterization in July of this year revealing total occlusion of the RCA and \

            the age of 52 from a myocardial infarction and another brother who is status post coronary artery bypass grafting. \
            The patient had a stress echocardiogram done on July , 2001 , which showed no wall motion abnormalities ,\
            but this was a difficult study due to body habitus. The patient went for six minutes with minimal ST depressions \
            in the anterior lateral leads , thought due to fatigue and wrist pain , his anginal equivalent. Due to the patient's \
            increased symptoms and family history and history left main disease with total occasional of his RCA was referred \
