FILE: sample_recognize_custom_entities.py

DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates how to recognize custom entities in documents.
    Recognizing custom entities is available as an action type through the begin_analyze_actions API.

    To train a model to recognize your custom entities, see https://aka.ms/azsdk/textanalytics/customentityrecognition

USAGE:
    python sample_recognize_custom_entities.py

    Set the environment variables with your own values before running the sample:
    1) AZURE_TEXT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT - the endpoint to your Cognitive Services resource.
    2) AZURE_TEXT_ANALYTICS_KEY - your Text Analytics subscription key
    3) CUSTOM_ENTITIES_PROJECT_NAME - your Text Analytics Language Studio project name
    4) CUSTOM_ENTITIES_DEPLOYMENT_NAME - your Text Analytics deployed model name
