# Azure Text Analytics client library for Python
Text Analytics is a cloud-based service that provides advanced natural language processing over raw text, and includes six main functions:

* Sentiment Analysis
* Named Entity Recognition
* Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Entity Recognition
* Linked Entity Recognition
* Language Detection
* Key Phrase Extraction

[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics) | [Package (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-textanalytics/) | [API reference documentation](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-textanalytics-ref-docs) | [Product documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/overview) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics/samples)

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
* Python 2.7, or 3.5 or later is required to use this package.
* You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and a
[Cognitive Services or Text Analytics resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account?tabs=multiservice%2Cwindows) to use this package.

### Install the package
Install the Azure Text Analytics client library for Python with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```bash
pip install azure-ai-textanalytics --pre
```

### Create a Cognitive Services or Text Analytics resource
Text Analytics supports both [multi-service and single-service access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account?tabs=multiservice%2Cwindows). 
Create a Cognitive Services resource if you plan to access multiple cognitive services under a single endpoint/key. For Text Analytics access only, create a Text Analytics resource.

You can create either resource using the
[Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account?tabs=multiservice%2Cwindows#create-a-new-azure-cognitive-services-resource)
or [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli?tabs=windows).
Below is an example of how you can create a Text Analytics resource using the CLI:

```bash
# Create a new resource group to hold the text analytics resource -
# if using an existing resource group, skip this step
az group create --name my-resource-group --location westus2
```

```bash
# Create text analytics
az cognitiveservices account create \
    --name text-analytics-resource \
    --resource-group my-resource-group \
    --kind TextAnalytics \
    --sku F0 \
    --location westus2 \
    --yes
```

### Authenticate the client
Interaction with this service begins with an instance of a [client](#client "ta-client"). 
To create a client object, you will need the cognitive services or text analytics `endpoint` to 
your resource and a `credential` that allows you access:

```python
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient

text_analytics = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint="https://westus2.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/", credential=credential)
```

Note that if you create a [custom subdomain](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains) 
name for your resource the endpoint may look different than in the above code snippet. 
For example, `https://<my-custom-subdomain>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/`.

#### Looking up the endpoint
You can find the endpoint for your text analytics resource using the 
[Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account?tabs=multiservice%2Cwindows#get-the-keys-for-your-resource)
or [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/cognitiveservices/account?view=azure-cli-latest#az-cognitiveservices-account-show):

```bash
# Get the endpoint for the text analytics resource
az cognitiveservices account show --name "resource-name" --resource-group "resource-group-name" --query "endpoint"
```

#### Types of credentials
The `credential` parameter may be provided as the subscription key to your resource or as a token from Azure Active Directory.
See the full details regarding [authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/authentication) of 
cognitive services.

1. To use a [subscription key](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account?tabs=multiservice%2Cwindows#get-the-keys-for-your-resource), 
   provide the key as a string. This can be found in the Azure Portal under the "Quickstart" 
   section or by running the following Azure CLI command:

    ```az cognitiveservices account keys list --name "resource-name" --resource-group "resource-group-name"```
    
    Use the key as the credential parameter to authenticate the client:
    ```python
    from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient
    text = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint="https://westus2.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/", credential="<subscription_key>")
    ```

2. To use an [Azure Active Directory (AAD) token credential](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/authentication#authenticate-with-azure-active-directory),
   provide an instance of the desired credential type obtained from the
   [azure-identity](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/identity/azure-identity#credentials) library.
   Note that regional endpoints do not support AAD authentication. Create a [custom subdomain](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/authentication#create-a-resource-with-a-custom-subdomain) 
   name for your resource in order to use this type of authentication.

   Authentication with AAD requires some initial setup:
   * [Install azure-identity](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/identity/azure-identity#install-the-package)
   * [Register a new AAD application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/authentication#assign-a-role-to-a-service-principal)
   * [Grant access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/authentication#assign-a-role-to-a-service-principal) to Text Analytics by assigning the `"Cognitive Services User"` role to your service principal.
   
   After setup, you can choose which type of [credential](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/identity/azure-identity#credentials) from azure.identity to use. 
   As an example, [DefaultAzureCredential](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/identity/azure-identity#defaultazurecredential)
   can be used to authenticate the client:

   Set the values of the client ID, tenant ID, and client secret of the AAD application as environment variables: 
   AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET

   Use the returned token credential to authenticate the client:
    ```python
    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
    from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient
    token_credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

    text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(
        endpoint="https://<my-custom-subdomain>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/",
        credential=token_credential
    )
    ```

## Key concepts

### Client
The Text Analytics client library provides a [TextAnalyticsClient](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-textanalytics-textanalyticsclient) to do analysis on batches of documents.
It provides both synchronous and asynchronous operations to access a specific use of Text Analytics, such as language detection or key phrase extraction. 

### Single text operations
The Text Analytics client library also provides module-level operations which can be performed on a single string
rather than a batch of documents. Each synchronous and asynchronous batching operation has a singular counterpart. 
The endpoint and credential are passed in with the desired text and other optional parameters, e.g. 
[single_analyze_sentiment()](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-textanalytics-singleanalyzesentiment):

```python
from azure.ai.textanalytics import single_analyze_sentiment

text = "I did not like the restaurant. The food was too spicy."
result = single_analyze_sentiment(endpoint=endpoint, credential=credential, input_text=text, language="en")
```

### Input
A **document** is a single unit to be analyzed by the predictive models in the Text Analytics service.
For the single text operations, the input document is simply passed as a string, e.g. `"hello world"`. 
For the batched operations, the input is passed as a list of documents. 

Documents can be passed as a list of strings, e.g.
```python
docs = ["I hated the movie. It was so slow!", "The movie made it into my top ten favorites.", "What a great movie!"]
```

or, if you wish to pass in a per-item document `id` or `language`/`country_hint`, they can be passed as a 
list of [DetectLanguageInput](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-textanalytics-detectlanguageinput) or 
[TextDocumentInput](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-textanalytics-textdocumentinput),
or a dict-like representation of the object:

```python
documents = [
    {"id": "1", "language": "en", "text": "I hated the movie. It was so slow!"}, 
    {"id": "2", "language": "en", "text": "The movie made it into my top ten favorites."}, 
    {"id": "3", "language": "en", "text": "What a great movie!"}
]
```

### Operation Result
An operation result, such as [AnalyzeSentimentResult](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-textanalytics-analyzesentimentresult), 
is the result of a Text Analytics operation and contains a prediction or predictions about a document input.
With a batching operation, a list is returned containing a collection of operation results and any document errors. 
These results/errors will be index-matched with the order of the provided documents.

    "The food was yummy. :)"
]

response = text_analytics_client.analyze_sentiment(documents, language="en")
result = [doc for doc in response if not doc.is_error]

for doc in result:
    print("Overall sentiment: {}".format(doc.sentiment))
    print("Scores: positive={0:.3f}; neutral={1:.3f}; negative={2:.3f} \n".format(

### Retry Policy configuration

Use the following keyword arguments when instantiating a client to configure the retry policy:

* __retry_total__ (int): Total number of retries to allow. Takes precedence over other counts.
Pass in `retry_total=0` if you do not want to retry on requests. Defaults to 10.
* __retry_connect__ (int): How many connection-related errors to retry on. Defaults to 3.
* __retry_read__ (int): How many times to retry on read errors. Defaults to 3.
* __retry_status__ (int): How many times to retry on bad status codes. Defaults to 3.

### Other client / per-operation configuration

Other optional configuration keyword arguments that can be specified on the client or per-operation.

**Client keyword arguments:**

* __connection_timeout__ (int): A single float in seconds for the connection timeout. Defaults to 300 seconds.
* __read_timeout__ (int): A single float in seconds for the read timeout. Defaults to 300 seconds.
* __transport__ (Any): User-provided transport to send the HTTP request.

**Per-operation keyword arguments:**

* __response_hook__ (callable): The given callback uses the raw response returned from the service.
Can also be passed in at the client.
* __request_id__ (str): Optional user specified identification of the request.
* __user_agent__ (str): Appends the custom value to the user-agent header to be sent with the request.
* __logging_enable__ (bool): Enables logging at the DEBUG level. Defaults to False. Can also be passed in at
the client level to enable it for all requests.
* __headers__ (dict): Pass in custom headers as key, value pairs. E.g. `headers={'CustomValue': value}`

## Troubleshooting
The Text Analytics client will raise exceptions defined in [Azure Core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/README.md).
