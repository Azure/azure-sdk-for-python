      into turmoil with the resignation of two senior Cabinet ministers in a deep
      split over her Brexit strategy. The Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, quit on
      Monday, hours after the resignation late on Sunday night of the minister in
      charge of Brexit negotiations, David Davis. Their decision to leave the government
      came three days after May appeared to have agreed a deal with herfractured Cabinet
      on the UK''s post Brexit relationship with the EU. That plan is now in tatters
      and her political future appears uncertain. May appeared in Parliament on Monday
      afternoon to defend her plan, minutes after Downing Street confirmed the departure
      of Johnson. May acknowledged the splits in her statement to MPs, saying of the
      ministers who quit: We do not agree about the best way of delivering our shared
      commitment to honoring the result of the referendum. The Prime Minister''s latest
      plitical drama began late on Sunday night when Davis quit, declaring he could
      not support May''s Brexit plan. He said it involved too close a relationship
      with the EU and gave only an illusion of control being returned to the UK after
      it left the EU. It seems to me we''re giving too much away, too easily, and
      that''s a dangerous strategy at this time, Davis said in a BBC radio interview
      Monday morning. Johnson''s resignation came Monday afternoon local time, just
      before the Prime Minister was due to make a scheduled statement in Parliament.
      This afternoon, the Prime Minister accepted the resignation of Boris Johnson
      as Foreign Secretary, a statement from Downing Street said.", "language": "en"},
