      "The government of British Prime Minster Theresa May has been plunged into turmoil
      with the resignation of two senior Cabinet ministers in a deep split over her
      Brexit strategy. The Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, quit on Monday, hours
      after the resignation late on Sunday night of the minister in charge of Brexit
      negotiations, David Davis. Their decision to leave the government came three
      days after May appeared to have agreed a deal with herfractured Cabinet on the
      UK''s post Brexit relationship with the EU. That plan is now in tatters and
      her political future appears uncertain. May appeared in Parliament on Monday
      afternoon to defend her plan, minutes after Downing Street confirmed the departure
      of Johnson. May acknowledged the splits in her statement to MPs, saying of the
      ministers who quit: We do not agree about the best way of delivering our shared
      commitment to honoring the result of the referendum. The Prime Minister''s latest
      plitical drama began late on Sunday night when Davis quit, declaring he could
      not support May''s Brexit plan. He said it involved too close a relationship
      with the EU and gave only an illusion of control being returned to the UK after
      it left the EU. It seems to me we''re giving too much away, too easily, and
      that''s a dangerous strategy at this time, Davis said in a BBC radio interview
      Monday morning. Johnson''s resignation came Monday afternoon local time, just
      before the Prime Minister was due to make a scheduled statement in Parliament.
      This afternoon, the Prime Minister accepted the resignation of Boris Johnson
      as Foreign Secretary, a statement from Downing Street said.", "language": "en"},
