      Prime Minster Theresa May has been plunged into turmoil with the resignation
      of two senior Cabinet ministers in a deep split over her Brexit strategy. The
      Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, quit on Monday, hours after the resignation
      late on Sunday night of the minister in charge of Brexit negotiations, David
      Davis. Their decision to leave the government came three days after May appeared
      to have agreed a deal with herfractured Cabinet on the UK''s post Brexit relationship
      with the EU. That plan is now in tatters and her political future appears uncertain.
      May appeared in Parliament on Monday afternoon to defend her plan, minutes after
      Downing Street confirmed the departure of Johnson. May acknowledged the splits
      in her statement to MPs, saying of the ministers who quit: We do not agree about
      the best way of delivering our shared commitment to honoring the result of the
      referendum. The Prime Minister''s latest plitical drama began late on Sunday
      night when Davis quit, declaring he could not support May''s Brexit plan. He
      said it involved too close a relationship with the EU and gave only an illusion
      of control being returned to the UK after it left the EU. It seems to me we''re
      giving too much away, too easily, and that''s a dangerous strategy at this time,
      Davis said in a BBC radio interview Monday morning. Johnson''s resignation came
      Monday afternoon local time, just before the Prime Minister was due to make
      a scheduled statement in Parliament. This afternoon, the Prime Minister accepted
      the resignation of Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary, a statement from Downing
      Street said.", "language": "en"}]}}'
