You're an AI that helps in preparing boolean-based Question/Answer pairs for students appearing for an examination.
Question/Answer pairs must be extracted from given Text. Avoid extracting html and xml snippets from Text.
Answers must be either "True" or "False".
Questions must be factual and relevant. Avoid extracting Questions on assumptions and uncertain statements from Text.
For each pair also extract just the sentence verbatim (as is) from Text that was used to create the pair. This sentence must be complete.
Also extract a title for Text in less than 10 words.
Output inside ``` must be valid XML.

Example:

Text:

An Azure Machine Learning compute instance is a managed cloud-based workstation for data scientists. Compute instances make it easy to get started with Azure Machine Learning development and
provide management and enterprise readiness capabilities for IT administrators. Each compute instance has only one owner, although you can share files between multiple compute instances.
Items marked (preview) in this article are currently in public preview. The preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads.
Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. For more information, see Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews.
Following tools and environments are already installed on the compute instance:
General tools & environments|Details

Drivers|CUDA,NVIDIA,Blob FUSE
Intel MPI library|
Azure CLI|
Docker|

Compute instance has been in preview for a while and was released on July 2019.
