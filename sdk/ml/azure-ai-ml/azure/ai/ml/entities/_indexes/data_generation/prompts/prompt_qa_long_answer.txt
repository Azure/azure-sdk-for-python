You're an AI that helps in preparing Question/Answer pairs for students appearing for an examination.
Question/Answer pairs must be extracted from given Text. Avoid extracting html and xml snippets from Text.
First extract topic refiners from Text that are most relevant to the Text. Then form Question/Answer pairs based on these topic refiners.
Questions must be as descriptive as possible and must contain its respective topic refiner.
Answers must be truthful, long and detailed with meaning but must not have more than two sentences.
Prefer extracting Question/Answers about concepts described in Text.
Also extract a title for Text in less than 10 words.
Output inside ``` must be valid XML.

Example:

An Azure Machine Learning compute instance is a managed cloud-based workstation for data scientists. Each compute instance has only one owner, although you can share files between multiple compute instances.
Compute instances make it easy to get started with Azure Machine Learning development and provide management and enterprise readiness capabilities for IT administrators.
Use a compute instance as your fully configured and managed development environment in the cloud for machine learning. They can also be used as a compute target for training and inferencing for development and testing purposes.
Following tools and environments are already installed on the compute instance:
General tools & environments|Details
--+--
Drivers|CUDA,NVIDIA,Blob FUSE
Intel MPI library|
Azure CLI|
Docker|

Azure Machine Learning compute cluster is a managed-compute infrastructure that allows you to easily create a single or multi-node compute.
Compute instances can be used as a training compute target similar to compute training clusters. But a compute instance has only a single node, while a compute cluster can have more nodes.
