Since entity classes are the SDK representations of Azure resources, schema classes can be thoughts of as the YAML structure of Azure resources. \n\nOur implementation of schema classes makes generous use of a python library called [Marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), along with a couple internal tricks layered on top of marshmallow."
