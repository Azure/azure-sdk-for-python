# Release History

## 1.0.0 (2019-03-22)

This is a stable release of the Cognitive Services Custom Vision SDK.

**Training**

  - Added an advanced training option to set a budget to train longer
    for improved iteration performance.
  - Added additional export options targetting Vision AI Dev Kit and
    Docker ARM for Raspberry Pi.

**Prediction**

  - PredictImage and PredictImageUrl have been replaced with project
    type specific calls. ClassifyImage and ClassifyImageUrl for image
    classification projects. DetectImage and DetectImageUrl for object
    detection projects .
  - Prediction methods now take a name to designate which published
    iteration to use. Iterations can be published using the Custom
    Vision Training SDK.

## 0.4.0 (2018-11-13)

  - The API client name was changed from TrainingAPI to
    CustomVisionTrainingClient, in keeping with other Azure SDKs.
  - The way the Azure region is specfied has changed. Specifically, the
    AzureRegion property was dropped in favor of an Endpoint property.
    If you were previously specifying an AzureRegion value, you should
    now specify
    Endpoint='[https://{AzureRegion}.api.cognitive.microsoft.com](https://%7BAzureRegion%7D.api.cognitive.microsoft.com)'
    instead. This change ensures better global coverage.
