        :type custom_config: str
        :param query: The user's search query term. The term may not be empty.
         The term may contain Bing Advanced Operators. For example, to limit
         results to a specific domain, use the site: operator.
        :type query: str
        :param accept_language: A comma-delimited list of one or more
         languages to use for user interface strings. The list is in decreasing
         order of preference. For additional information, including expected
         format, see
         [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).
         This header and the setLang query parameter are mutually exclusive; do
         not specify both. If you set this header, you must also specify the cc
         query parameter. Bing will use the first supported language it finds
         from the list, and combine that language with the cc parameter value
         to determine the market to return results for. If the list does not
         include a supported language, Bing will find the closest language and
         market that supports the request, and may use an aggregated or default
         market for the results instead of a specified one. You should use this
         header and the cc query parameter only if you specify multiple
         languages; otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query
         parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label
         in a user interface. There are very few user interface strings in the
         JSON response objects. Any links in the response objects to Bing.com
         properties will apply the specified language.
        :type accept_language: str
        :param user_agent: The user agent originating the request. Bing uses
         the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized experience.
         Although optional, you are strongly encouraged to always specify this
         header. The user-agent should be the same string that any commonly
         used browser would send. For information about user agents, see [RFC
         2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).
        :type user_agent: str
        :param client_id: Bing uses this header to provide users with
         consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new
         features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for
         assigning traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same
         client ID for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign
         the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple
         conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience. For
         example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than
         the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the
         client ID to tailor web results to that client IDâ€™s search history,
         providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header
         to help improve result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by
         a client ID. The relevance improvements help with better quality of
         results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher
         click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although
         optional, you should consider this header required. Persisting the
         client ID across multiple requests for the same end user and device
         combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a consistent user
         experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of
         results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application on
         the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not
         include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns
         it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you
         should NOT include this header in a request is the first time the user
         uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API
         request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the
         client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP
         cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a
         session cookie. For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's
         persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the user uses your
         app on that device, get the client ID that you persisted. Bing
         responses may or may not include this header. If the response includes
         this header, capture the client ID and use it for all subsequent Bing
         requests for the user on that device. If you include the
         X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
        :type client_id: str
        :param client_ip: The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The
         IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses the
         location information to determine safe search behavior. Although
         optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
         X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example,
         by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in
         the location not being anywhere near the device's actual location,
         which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.
        :type client_ip: str
        :param location: A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that
         describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the location
         information to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant
         local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The
         following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location.
         lat (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The
         latitude must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal
         to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive
         values indicate northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of
         the client's location, in degrees. The longitude must be greater than
         or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative values
         indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern
         longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the
         horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the
         device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi,
         380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup.
         ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
         location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January
         1, 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction
         of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through
         360, counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only
         if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity
         (speed), in meters per second, that the client device is traveling.
         alt (optional): The altitude of the client device, in meters. are
         (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies the vertical
         accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you specify the
         alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more information
         that you provide, the more accurate the location results are. Although
         optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's geographical
         location. Providing the location is especially important if the
         client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical
         location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results,
         you should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but
         at a minimum, you should include this header.
        :type location: str
        :param country_code: A 2-character country code of the country where
         the results come from. This API supports only the United States
         market. If you specify this query parameter, it must be set to us. If
         you set this parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language
         header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the
         languages list, and combine that language with the country code that
         you specify to determine the market to return results for. If the
         languages list does not include a supported language, Bing finds the
         closest language and market that supports the request, or it may use
         an aggregated or default market for the results instead of a specified
         one. You should use this query parameter and the Accept-Language query
         parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you
         should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This parameter and
         the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusiveâ€”do not specify both.
        :type country_code: str
        :param count: The number of search results to return in the response.
         The default is 10 and the maximum value is 50. The actual number
         delivered may be less than requested.Use this parameter along with the
         offset parameter to page results.For example, if your user interface
         displays 10 search results per page, set count to 10 and offset to 0
         to get the first page of results. For each subsequent page, increment
         offset by 10 (for example, 0, 10, 20). It is possible for multiple
         pages to include some overlap in results.
        :type count: int
        :param market: The market where the results come from. Typically, mkt
         is the country where the user is making the request from. However, it
         could be a different country if the user is not located in a country
         where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form <language
         code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The string is case
         insensitive. If known, you are encouraged to always specify the
         market. Specifying the market helps Bing route the request and return
         an appropriate and optimal response. If you specify a market that is
         not listed in Market Codes, Bing uses a best fit market code based on
         an internal mapping that is subject to change. This parameter and the
         cc query parameter are mutually exclusiveâ€”do not specify both.
        :type market: str
        :param offset: The zero-based offset that indicates the number of
         search results to skip before returning results. The default is 0. The
         offset should be less than (totalEstimatedMatches - count). Use this
         parameter along with the count parameter to page results. For example,
         if your user interface displays 10 search results per page, set count
         to 10 and offset to 0 to get the first page of results. For each
         subsequent page, increment offset by 10 (for example, 0, 10, 20). it
         is possible for multiple pages to include some overlap in results.
        :type offset: int
        :param safe_search: A filter used to filter adult content. Off: Return
         webpages with adult text, images, or videos. Moderate: Return webpages
         with adult text, but not adult images or videos. Strict: Do not return
         webpages with adult text, images, or videos. The default is Moderate.
         If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires
         that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value
         and uses Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the
         chance that the response may contain adult content regardless of what
         the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are
         aware of the content on the site and your scenario supports the
         possibility of adult content. Possible values include: 'Off',
         'Moderate', 'Strict'
        :type safe_search: str or
         ~azure.cognitiveservices.search.customsearch.models.SafeSearch
        :param set_lang: The language to use for user interface strings.
         Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For
         example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN
         (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.
         Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt
         unless the user wants the user interface strings displayed in a
         different language. This parameter and the Accept-Language header are
         mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string is a
         string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
         interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to
         Bing.com properties in the response objects apply the specified
         language.
        :type set_lang: str
        :param text_decorations: A Boolean value that determines whether
         display strings should contain decoration markers such as hit
         highlighting characters. If true, the strings may include markers. The
         default is false. To specify whether to use Unicode characters or HTML
         tags as the markers, see the textFormat query parameter.
        :type text_decorations: bool
        :param text_format: The type of markers to use for text decorations
         (see the textDecorations query parameter). Possible values are Rawâ€”Use
         Unicode characters to mark content that needs special formatting. The
         Unicode characters are in the range E000 through E019. For example,
         Bing uses E000 and E001 to mark the beginning and end of query terms
         for hit highlighting. HTMLâ€”Use HTML tags to mark content that needs
         special formatting. For example, use <b> tags to highlight query terms
         in display strings. The default is Raw. For display strings that
         contain escapable HTML characters such as <, >, and &, if textFormat
         is set to HTML, Bing escapes the characters as appropriate (for
         example, < is escaped to &lt;). Possible values include: 'Raw', 'Html'
