## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+ is required to use this package.
- [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)

### Install the package

```bash
pip install azure-mgmt-desktopvirtualization
pip install azure-identity
```

### Authentication

By default, [Azure Active Directory](https://aka.ms/awps/aad) token authentication depends on correct configure of following environment variables.

- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` for Azure client ID.
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID` for Azure tenant ID.
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` for Azure client secret.

In addition, Azure subscription ID can be configured via environment variable `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`.

With above configuration, client can be authenticated by following code:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.desktopvirtualization import DesktopVirtualizationMgmtClient
import os

sub_id = os.getenv("AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID")
client = DesktopVirtualizationMgmtClient(credential=DefaultAzureCredential(), subscription_id=sub_id)
```
