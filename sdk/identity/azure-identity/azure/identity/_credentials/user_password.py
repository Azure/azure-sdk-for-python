    In general, Microsoft doesn't recommend this kind of authentication, because it's less secure than other
    authentication flows.

    Authentication with this credential is not interactive, so it is **not compatible with any form of
    multi-factor authentication or consent prompting**. The application must already have consent from the user or
    a directory admin.

    This credential can only authenticate work and school accounts; Microsoft accounts are not supported.
    See this document for more information about account types:
