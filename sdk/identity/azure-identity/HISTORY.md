# Release History

## 1.0.0b1 (2019-06-28)
Version 1.0.0b1 is the first preview of our efforts to create a user-friendly
and Pythonic authentication API for Azure SDK client libraries. For more
information about preview releases of other Azure SDK libraries, please visit
https://aka.ms/azure-sdk-preview1-python.

This release supports service principal and managed identity authentication.
See the
[documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/identity/azure-identity/README.md)
for more details. User authentication will be added in an upcoming preview
release.

This release supports only global Azure Active Directory tenants, i.e. those
using the https://login.microsoftonline.com authentication endpoint.
