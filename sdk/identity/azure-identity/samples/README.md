# Azure Identity Library Python Samples

## Prerequisites

You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/python) and an
[Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/) to run
these samples. You can create a Key Vault in the
[Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.KeyVault) or with the
[Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/secrets/quick-create-cli).

Azure Key Vault is used only to demonstrate authentication. Azure Identity has
the same API for all compatible client libraries.

## Setup

To run these samples, first install the Azure Identity and Key Vault Certificates
and Secrets client libraries:

```commandline
pip install azure-identity azure-keyvault-certificates azure-keyvault-secrets
```
