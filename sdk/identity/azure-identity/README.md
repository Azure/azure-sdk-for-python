# Azure Identity client library for Python
Azure Identity simplifies authentication across the Azure SDK.
It supports token authentication using an Azure Active Directory
[service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli)
or
[managed identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).

# Getting started
## Prerequisites
- an Azure subscription
  - if you don't have one, you can sign up for a
  [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- Python 2.7 or 3.5.3+

## Install the package
Install Azure Identity with pip:
```sh
pip install azure-identity
```

# Key concepts
## Credentials
Azure Identity offers a variety of credential classes in the `azure.identity`
namespace. These are accepted by Azure SDK data plane clients. Each client
library documents its Azure Identity integration in its README and samples.
Azure SDK resource management libraries (which have `mgmt` in their names)
do not accept these credentials.

Credentials differ mostly in configuration:

|credential class|identity|configuration
|-|-|-
|`DefaultAzureCredential`|service principal or managed identity|none for managed identity; [environment variables](#environment-variables) for service principal
|`ManagedIdentityCredential`|managed identity|none
|`EnvironmentCredential`|service principal|[environment variables](#environment-variables)
|`ClientSecretCredential`|service principal|constructor parameters
|`CertificateCredential`|service principal|constructor parameters

Credentials can be chained and tried in turn until one succeeds; see
[chaining credentials](#chaining-credentials) for details.

All credentials have an async equivalent in the `azure.identity.aio` namespace.
These are supported on Python 3.5.3+. See the
[async credentials](#async-credentials) example for details.

## DefaultAzureCredential
`DefaultAzureCredential` is appropriate for most scenarios. It supports
authenticating as a service principal or managed identity. To authenticate
as a service principal, provide configuration in environment variables as
described in the next section.

Authenticating as a managed identity requires no configuration, but does
require platform support. See the
[managed identity documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-managed-identities)
for more information.

## Environment variables

`DefaultAzureCredential` and `EnvironmentCredential` are configured for service
principal authentication with these environment variables:

|variable name|value
|-|-
|`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`|service principal's app id
|`AZURE_TENANT_ID`|id of the principal's Azure Active Directory tenant
|`AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`|one of the service principal's client secrets
|`AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH`|path to a PEM-encoded certificate file including private key (without password)

Either `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` or `AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH` must be set.
If both are set, the client secret will be used.

# Examples

## `DefaultAzureCredential`
```py
# The default credential first checks environment variables for configuration as described above.
# If environment configuration is incomplete, it will try managed identity.
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Azure SDK clients accept the credential as a parameter
from azure.keyvault.secrets import SecretClient

client = SecretClient(vault_url, credential)
```

## Authenticating as a service principal:
```py
# using a client secret
from azure.identity import ClientSecretCredential

credential = ClientSecretCredential(client_id, client_secret, tenant_id)

# using a certificate
from azure.identity import CertificateCredential

# requires a PEM-encoded certificate with private key, not protected with a password
cert_path = "/app/certs/certificate.pem"
credential = CertificateCredential(client_id, tenant_id, cert_path)

# using environment variables
from azure.identity import EnvironmentCredential

# authenticate with client secret or certificate,
# depending on environment variable settings
# (see "Environment variables" above for variable names and expected values)
credential = EnvironmentCredential()
```

## Chaining credentials:
```py
from azure.identity import ClientSecretCredential, ManagedIdentityCredential, ChainedTokenCredential

first_principal = ClientSecretCredential(client_id, client_secret, tenant_id)
second_principal = ClientSecretCredential(another_client_id, another_secret, tenant_id)

# when an access token is requested, the chain will try each
# credential in order, stopping when one provides a token
credential_chain = ChainedTokenCredential(first_principal, second_principal)

# the chain can be used anywhere a credential is required
from azure.keyvault.secrets import SecretClient

client = SecretClient(vault_url, credential=credential_chain)
```

## Async credentials:
```py
# all credentials have async equivalents supported on Python 3.5.3+
from azure.identity.aio import DefaultAzureCredential

default_credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# async credentials have the same API and configuration as
# their synchronous counterparts...
from azure.identity.aio import ClientSecretCredential

credential = ClientSecretCredential(client_id, client_secret, tenant_id)

# ...and are used with async Azure SDK clients in the same way
from azure.keyvault.aio import SecretClient

client = SecretClient(vault_url, credential)
```

# Troubleshooting
## General
Credentials raise `azure.core.exceptions.ClientAuthenticationError` when they fail
to authenticate. `ClientAuthenticationError` has a `message` attribute which
describes why authentication failed. When raised by `ChainedTokenCredential`,
the message collects error messages from each credential in the chain.
