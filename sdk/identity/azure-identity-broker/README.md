# Azure Identity Broker plugin for Python

This package extends the [Azure Identity][azure_identity] library by providing supplemental credentials for authenticating via an authentication broker.

An authentication broker is an application that runs on a userâ€™s machine that manages the authentication handshakes and token maintenance for connected accounts. Currently, only the Windows authentication broker, Web Account Manager (WAM), is supported.

## Getting started

### Install the package

Install the Azure Identity Broker plugin for Python with [pip][pip]:

```bash
pip install azure-identity-broker
```

## Key concepts

This package enables broker support via `InteractiveBrowserBrokerCredential` which is a subclass of the `InteractiveBrowserCredential` of the Azure Identity library.

### Parent window handles

When authenticating interactively via `InteractiveBrowserBrokerCredential`, a parent window handle is required to ensure that the authentication dialog is shown correctly over the requesting window. In the context of graphical user interfaces on devices, a window handle is a unique identifier that the operating system assigns to each window. For the Windows operating system, this handle is an integer value that serves as a reference to a specific window.

## Microsoft account (MSA) passthrough

Microsoft accounts (MSA) are personal accounts created by users to access Microsoft services. MSA passthrough is a legacy configuration which enables users to get tokens to resources which normally don't accept MSA logins. This feature is only available to first-party applications. Users authenticating with an application that is configured to use MSA passthrough can set `enable_msa_passthrough` to `True` inside `InteractiveBrowserBrokerCredential` to allow these personal accounts to be listed by WAM.

## Redirect URIs

Microsoft Entra applications rely on redirect URIs to determine where to send the authentication response after a user has logged in. To enable brokered authentication through WAM, a redirect URI matching the following pattern should be registered to the application:

```
ms-appx-web://Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin/{client_id}
```

## Examples

### Authenticate with `InteractiveBrowserBrokerCredential`

This example demonstrates using `InteractiveBrowserBrokerCredential` as a broker-enabled credential for authenticating with the `BlobServiceClient` from the [azure-storage-blob][azure_storage_blob] library. Here, the `win32gui` package is used to get the current window.

```python
import win32gui
from azure.identity.broker import InteractiveBrowserBrokerCredential
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient

# Get the handle of the current window
current_window_handle = win32gui.GetForegroundWindow()

credential = InteractiveBrowserBrokerCredential(parent_window_handle=current_window_handle)
client = BlobServiceClient(account_url, credential=default_credential)
```

## Troubleshooting

See the Azure Identity [troubleshooting guide][troubleshooting_guide] for details on how to diagnose various failure scenarios.

## Next steps

### Client library support

Client and management libraries listed on the [Azure SDK release page](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/python.html) that support Microsoft Entra authentication accept credentials from this library. You can learn more about using these libraries in their documentation, which is linked from the release page.

### Known issues

This library doesn't support [Azure AD B2C][b2c].

For other open issues, refer to the library's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AAzure.Identity).
