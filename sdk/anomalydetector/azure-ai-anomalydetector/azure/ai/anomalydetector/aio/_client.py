    """The Anomaly Detector API detects anomalies automatically in time series data. It supports two
    kinds of mode, one is for stateless using, another is for stateful using. In stateless mode,
    there are three functionalities. Entire Detect is for detecting the whole series with model
    trained by the time series, Last Detect is detecting last point with model trained by points
    before. ChangePoint Detect is for detecting trend changes in time series. In stateful mode,
    user can store time series, the stored time series will be used for detection anomalies. Under
    this mode, user can still use the above three functionalities by only giving a time range
    without preparing time series in client side. Besides the above three functionalities, stateful
    model also provide group based detection and labeling service. By leveraging labeling service
    user can provide labels for each detection result, these labels will be used for retuning or
    regenerating detection models. Inconsistency detection is a kind of group based detection, this
    detection will find inconsistency ones in a set of time series. By using anomaly detector
    service, business customers can discover incidents and establish a logic flow for root cause
    analysis.
