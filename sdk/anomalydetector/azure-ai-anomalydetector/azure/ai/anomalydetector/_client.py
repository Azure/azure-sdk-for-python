    """The Anomaly Detector API detects anomalies automatically in time series data.
    It supports both a stateless detection mode and a
    stateful detection mode. In stateless mode, there are three functionalities. Entire
    Detect is for detecting the whole series, with the model trained by the time series.
    Last Detect is for detecting the last point, with the model trained by points before.
    ChangePoint Detect is for detecting trend changes in the time series. In stateful
    mode, the user can store time series. The stored time series will be used for
    detection anomalies. In this mode, the user can still use the preceding three
    functionalities by only giving a time range without preparing time series on the
    client side. Besides the preceding three functionalities, the stateful model
    provides group-based detection and labeling services. By using the labeling
    service, the user can provide labels for each detection result. These labels will be
    used for retuning or regenerating detection models. Inconsistency detection is
    a kind of group-based detection that finds inconsistencies in
    a set of time series. By using the anomaly detector service, business customers can
    discover incidents and establish a logic flow for root cause analysis.
