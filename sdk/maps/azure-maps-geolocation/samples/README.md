# Samples for Azure Maps Geolocation client library for Python

These code samples show common scenario operations with the Azure Maps Geolocation client library.

Authenticate the client with a Azure Maps Geolocation [API Key Credential](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/how-to-manage-account-keys):

[samples authentication](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/maps/azure-maps-geolocation/samples/sample_authentication.py) ([async version](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/maps/azure-maps-geolocation/samples/async_samples/sample_authentication_async.py))

Then for common Azure Maps Geolocation operations:

* Perform get geolocation: [sample_get_country_code.py](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/maps/azure-maps-geolocation/samples/sample_get_country_code.py) ([async version](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/maps/azure-maps-geolocation/samples/async_samples/sample_get_country_code_async.py))

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.6 or later is required to use this package
* You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* A deployed Maps Services resource. You can create the resource via [Azure Portal][azure_portal] or [Azure CLI][azure_cli].

## Setup

1. Install the Azure Maps Geolocation client library for Python with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

   ```bash
   pip install azure-maps-geolocation --pre
   ```

2. Clone or download [this repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python)
3. Open this sample folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or your IDE of choice.

## Running the samples

1. Open a terminal window and `cd` to the directory that the samples are saved in.
2. Set the environment variables specified in the sample file you wish to run.
3. Follow the usage described in the file, e.g. `python sample_get_country_code.py`
