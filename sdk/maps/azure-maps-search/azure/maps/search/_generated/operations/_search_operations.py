        The Get Polygon service allows you to request the geometry data such as a city or country

        lifetime. The client  should not store geometry IDs in persistent storage for later referral,

        **Applies to**\ : S0 and S1 pricing tiers.

        The basic default API is Free Form Search which handles the most fuzzy of inputs handling any
        combination of address or POI tokens. This search API is the canonical 'single line search'.
        The Free Form Search API is a seamless combination of POI search and geocoding. The API can
        also be weighted with a contextual position (lat./lon. pair), or fully constrained by a
        coordinate and radius, or it can be executed more generally without any geo biasing anchor
        point.:code:`<br>`:code:`<br>`We strongly advise you to use the 'countrySet' parameter to
        specify only the countries for which your application needs coverage, as the default behavior
        will be to search the entire world, potentially returning unnecessary
        results.:code:`<br>`:code:`<br>` E.g.: ``countrySet``\ =US,FR :code:`<br>`:code:`<br>`Please

        Search queries default to ``maxFuzzyLevel``\ =2 to gain performance and also reduce unusual
        results. This new default can be overridden as needed per request by passing in the query param
        ``maxFuzzyLevel``\ =3 or 4.

        :param query: The applicable query string (e.g., "seattle", "pizza"). Can *also* be specified
         as a comma separated string composed by latitude followed by longitude (e.g., "47.641268,

         multiple category identifiers are provided, only POIs that belong to (at least) one of the
         categories from the provided list will be returned. The list of supported categories can be
         discovered using  `POI Categories API <https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPOICategoryTree>`_. Usage
         examples:


         *
           **categorySet=7315**\  (Search Points of Interest from category Restaurant)

         *

         defined area.
        :type radius_in_meters: int
        :param top_left: Top left position of the bounding box. E.g. 37.553,-122.453.
        :type top_left: str
        :param btm_right: Bottom right position of the bounding box. E.g. 37.553,-122.453.
        :type btm_right: str
        :param language: Language in which search results should be returned. Should be one of
         supported IETF language tags, case insensitive. When data in specified language is not
         available for a specific field, default language is used.

         Please refer to `Supported Languages <https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/supported-
         languages>`_ for details.
        :type language: str
        :param extended_postal_codes_for: Indexes for which extended postal codes should be included in
         the results.

         Available indexes are:

          **Addr** = Address ranges

          **Geo** = Geographies

          **PAD** = Point Addresses

          **POI** = Points of Interest

          **Str** = Streets

          **XStr** = Cross Streets (intersections)

         Value should be a comma separated list of index types (in any order) or **None** for no
         indexes.

         By default extended postal codes are included for all indexes except Geo. Extended postal code
         lists for geographies can be quite long so they have to be explicitly requested when needed.

         Usage examples:

          extendedPostalCodesFor=POI

          extendedPostalCodesFor=PAD,Addr,POI

          extendedPostalCodesFor=None

         Extended postal code is returned as an **extendedPostalCode** property of an address.

         *
           Level 1 has no spell checking.

         *
           Level 2 uses normal n-gram spell checking. For example, query "restrant" can be matched to
         "restaurant."

         *
           Level 3 uses sound-like spell checking, and shingle spell checking. Sound-like spell

        :param brand_filter: A comma-separated list of brand names which could be used to restrict the
         result to specific brands. Item order does not matter. When multiple brands are provided, only
         results that belong to (at least) one of the provided list will be returned. Brands that
         contain a "," in their name should be put into quotes.

         Usage examples:

          brandSet=Foo

          brandSet=Foo,Bar

          brandSet="A,B,C Comma",Bar.
        :type brand_filter: list[str]
        :param electric_vehicle_connector_filter: A comma-separated list of connector types which could
         be used to restrict the result to Electric Vehicle Station supporting specific connector types.
         Item order does not matter. When multiple connector types are provided, only results that
         belong to (at least) one of the provided list will be returned.

         Available connector types are:


         * ``StandardHouseholdCountrySpecific`` - These are the standard household connectors for a
         certain region. They are all AC single phase and the standard Voltage and standard Amperage.

         as a socket set into the charging point.
         * ``IEC62196Type2CCS`` - Type 2 based combo connector as defined in the IEC 62196-3 standard.
         The connector is based on the Type 2 connector – as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard – with
         two additional direct current (DC) contacts to allow DC fast charging.
         * ``IEC62196Type3`` - Type 3 connector as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard. Also called
         Scame after the original manufacturer. Mostly used in combination with up to 240V single phase
         or up to 420V three phase infrastructure.
         * ``Chademo`` - CHAdeMO connector named after an association formed by the Tokyo Electric
         Power Company and industrial partners. Because of this is is also known as the TEPCO's
         connector. It supports fast DC charging.
         * ``IEC60309AC1PhaseBlue`` - Industrial Blue connector is a connector defined in the IEC 60309
         standard. It is sometime referred to as by some combination of the standard, the color and the
         fact that is a single phase connector. The connector usually has the "P+N+E, 6h" configuration.
         * ``IEC60309DCWhite`` - Industrial White connector is a DC connector defined in the IEC 60309
         standard.
         * ``Tesla`` - The Tesla connector is the regionally specific Tesla Supercharger connector.
         I.e. it refers to either Tesla's proprietary connector, sometimes referred to as Tesla Port
         mostly limited to North America or the modified Type 2 (DC over Type 2) in Europe.

         Usage examples:

          connectorSet=IEC62196Type2CableAttached
          connectorSet=IEC62196Type2Outlet,IEC62196Type2CableAttached.
        :type electric_vehicle_connector_filter: list[str or ~azure.maps.search.models.ElectricVehicleConnector]
        :param entity_type: Specifies the level of filtering performed on geographies. Narrows the
         search for specified geography entity types, e.g. return only municipality. The resulting
         response will contain the geography ID as well as the entity type matched. If you provide more
         than one entity as a comma separated list, endpoint will return the 'smallest entity
         available'. Returned Geometry ID can be used to get the geometry of that geography via `Get
         Search Polygon <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchpolygon>`_ API. The
         following parameters are ignored when entityType is set:

        :type entity_type: str or ~azure.maps.search.models.GeographicEntityType
        :param localized_map_view: The View parameter (also called the "user region" parameter) allows
         you to show the correct maps for a certain country/region for geopolitically disputed regions.
         Different countries have different views of such regions, and the View parameter allows your
         application to comply with the view required by the country your application will be serving.
         By default, the View parameter is set to “Unified” even if you haven’t defined it in  the
         request. It is your responsibility to determine the location of your users, and then set the
         View parameter correctly for that location. Alternatively, you have the option to set
         ‘View=Auto’, which will return the map data based on the IP  address of the request. The View
         parameter in Azure Maps must be used in compliance with applicable laws, including those
         regarding mapping, of the country where maps, images and other data and third party content
         that you are authorized to  access via Azure Maps is made available. Example: view=IN.

         <https://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plugs-and-sockets>`_.
         * ``IEC62196Type1`` - Type 1 connector as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard. Also called
         Yazaki after the original manufacturer or SAE J1772 after the standard that first published it.
         Mostly used in combination with 120V single phase or up to 240V single phase infrastructure.
         * ``IEC62196Type1CCS`` - Type 1 based combo connector as defined in the IEC 62196-3 standard.
         The connector is based on the Type 1 connector – as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard – with
         two additional direct current (DC) contacts to allow DC fast charging.
         * ``IEC62196Type2CableAttached`` - Type 2 connector as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard.
         Provided as a cable and plug attached to the charging point.

         * ``Chademo`` - CHAdeMO connector named after an association formed by the Tokyo Electric
         Power Company and industrial partners. Because of this is is also known as the TEPCO's
         connector. It supports fast DC charging.
         * ``IEC60309AC1PhaseBlue`` - Industrial Blue connector is a connector defined in the IEC 60309
         standard. It is sometime referred to as by some combination of the standard, the color and the
         fact that is a single phase connector. The connector usually has the "P+N+E, 6h" configuration.
         * ``IEC60309DCWhite`` - Industrial White connector is a DC connector defined in the IEC 60309
         standard.
         * ``Tesla`` - The Tesla connector is the regionally specific Tesla Supercharger connector.

        :param localized_map_view: The View parameter (also called the "user region" parameter) allows
         you to show the correct maps for a certain country/region for geopolitically disputed regions.
         Different countries have different views of such regions, and the View parameter allows your
         application to comply with the view required by the country your application will be serving.
         By default, the View parameter is set to “Unified” even if you haven’t defined it in  the
         request. It is your responsibility to determine the location of your users, and then set the
         View parameter correctly for that location. Alternatively, you have the option to set
         ‘View=Auto’, which will return the map data based on the IP  address of the request. The View
         parameter in Azure Maps must be used in compliance with applicable laws, including those
         regarding mapping, of the country where maps, images and other data and third party content
         that you are authorized to  access via Azure Maps is made available. Example: view=IN.

        **Applies to**\ : S0 and S1 pricing tiers.

        In many cases, the complete search service might be too much, for instance if you are only
        interested in traditional geocoding. Search can also be accessed for address look up
        exclusively. The geocoding is performed by hitting the geocode endpoint with just the address
        or partial address in question. The geocoding search index will be queried for everything above
        the street level data. No POIs will be returned. Note that the geocoder is very tolerant of
        typos and incomplete addresses. It will also handle everything from exact street addresses or
        street or intersections as well as higher level geographies such as city centers, counties,
        states etc.

        :param query: The address to search for (e.g., "1 Microsoft way, Redmond, WA"), must be
         properly URL encoded.
        :type query: str
        :param format: Desired format of the response. Value can be either *json* or *xml*.
        :type format: str or ~azure.maps.search.models.ResponseFormat
        :param is_type_ahead: Boolean. If the typeahead flag is set, the query will be interpreted as a
         partial input and the search will enter predictive mode.
        :type is_type_ahead: bool
        :param top: Maximum number of responses that will be returned. Default: 10, minimum: 1 and
         maximum: 100.
        :type top: int
        :param skip: Starting offset of the returned results within the full result set. Default: 0,
         minimum: 0 and maximum: 1900.
        :type skip: int
        :param country_filter: Comma separated string of country codes, e.g. FR,ES. This will limit the

        :type country_filter: list[str]
        :param lat: Latitude where results should be biased. E.g. 37.337.
        :type lat: float
        :param lon: Longitude where results should be biased. E.g. -121.89.
        :type lon: float

         defined area.
        :type radius_in_meters: int

         supported IETF language tags, case insensitive. When data in specified language is not
         available for a specific field, default language is used.

        :type language: str
        :param extended_postal_codes_for: Indexes for which extended postal codes should be included in
         the results.

         Available indexes are:

          **Addr** = Address ranges

          **Geo** = Geographies

          **PAD** = Point Addresses

          **POI** = Points of Interest

          **Str** = Streets

          **XStr** = Cross Streets (intersections)

         Value should be a comma separated list of index types (in any order) or **None** for no
         indexes.

         By default extended postal codes are included for all indexes except Geo. Extended postal code
         lists for geographies can be quite long so they have to be explicitly requested when needed.

         Usage examples:

          extendedPostalCodesFor=POI

          extendedPostalCodesFor=PAD,Addr,POI

          extendedPostalCodesFor=None

         Extended postal code is returned as an **extendedPostalCode** property of an address.
         Availability is region-dependent.
        :type extended_postal_codes_for: list[str or ~azure.maps.search.models.SearchIndexes]
        :param entity_type: Specifies the level of filtering performed on geographies. Narrows the
         search for specified geography entity types, e.g. return only municipality. The resulting
         response will contain the geography ID as well as the entity type matched. If you provide more
         than one entity as a comma separated list, endpoint will return the 'smallest entity
         available'. Returned Geometry ID can be used to get the geometry of that geography via `Get
         Search Polygon <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchpolygon>`_ API. The
         following parameters are ignored when entityType is set:

         * number
         * returnRoadUse
         * returnSpeedLimit
         * roadUse
         * returnMatchType.
        :type entity_type: str or ~azure.maps.search.models.GeographicEntityType
        :param localized_map_view: The View parameter (also called the "user region" parameter) allows
         you to show the correct maps for a certain country/region for geopolitically disputed regions.
         Different countries have different views of such regions, and the View parameter allows your
         application to comply with the view required by the country your application will be serving.
         By default, the View parameter is set to “Unified” even if you haven’t defined it in  the
         request. It is your responsibility to determine the location of your users, and then set the
         View parameter correctly for that location. Alternatively, you have the option to set
         ‘View=Auto’, which will return the map data based on the IP  address of the request. The View
         parameter in Azure Maps must be used in compliance with applicable laws, including those

         By default, the View parameter is set to “Unified” even if you haven’t defined it in  the
         request. It is your responsibility to determine the location of your users, and then set the
         View parameter correctly for that location. Alternatively, you have the option to set
         ‘View=Auto’, which will return the map data based on the IP  address of the request. The View
         parameter in Azure Maps must be used in compliance with applicable laws, including those
         regarding mapping, of the country where maps, images and other data and third party content
         that you are authorized to  access via Azure Maps is made available. Example: view=IN.

        """**Search Fuzzy Batch API**

        **Applies to**\ : S1 pricing tier.

        The Search Address Batch API sends batches of queries to `Search Fuzzy API
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchfuzzy>`_ using just a single API
        call. You can call Search Address Fuzzy Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or
        synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync
        API up to **100** queries.

        Submit Synchronous Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a
        request, it will respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no
        possibility to retrieve the results later. The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a
        408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The number of batch items is limited
        to **100** for this API.

        .. code-block::

           POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&subscription-
        key={subscription-key}

        Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search
        requests


        * It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
        * The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
        * The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.

        When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response
        code along a redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be
        checked periodically until the response data or error information is available.
        The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response
        if used after the expiration period.

        Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running request. Here's a typical
        sequence of operations:


        #. Client sends a Search Address Batch ``POST`` request to Azure Maps
        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Batch request has been accepted.

              HTTP ``Error`` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a
        ``400 Bad Request`` or any other ``Error`` status code.


        #.
           If the batch request was accepted successfully, the ``Location`` header in the response
        contains the URL to download the results of the batch request.
            This status URI looks like following:

        .. code-block::

               GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-
        version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}


        #. Client issues a ``GET`` request on the *download URL* obtained in Step 3 to download the
        batch results.

        POST Body for Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        To send the *search fuzzy* queries you will use a ``POST`` request where the request body will
        contain the ``batchItems`` array in ``json`` format and the ``Content-Type`` header will be set
        to ``application/json``. Here's a sample request body containing 5 *search fuzzy* queries:

        .. code-block:: json

           {
               "batchItems": [
                   {"query": "?query=atm&lat=47.639769&lon=-122.128362&radius=5000&limit=5"},
                   {"query": "?query=Statue Of Liberty&limit=2"},
                   {"query": "?query=Starbucks&lat=47.639769&lon=-122.128362&radius=5000"},
                   {"query": "?query=Space Needle"},
                   {"query": "?query=pizza&limit=10"}
               ]
           }

        A *search fuzzy* query in a batch is just a partial URL *without* the protocol, base URL, path,
        api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported *search fuzzy* `URI
        parameters <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchfuzzy#uri-parameters>`_.
        The string values in the *search fuzzy* query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should
        be escaped with ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.

        The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100**
        queries, and the batch should contain at least **1** query.

        Download Asynchronous Batch Results
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        To download the async batch results you will issue a ``GET`` request to the batch download
        endpoint. This *download URL* can be obtained from the ``Location`` header of a successful
        ``POST`` batch request and looks like the following:

        .. code-block::

           https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&subscription-
        key={subscription-key}

        Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:


        #. Client sends a ``GET`` request using the *download URL*.
        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please
        try again in some time.

              HTTP ``200 OK`` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all
        the batch results.


        Batch Response Model
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results
        of an async batch request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the
        batch response. This batch response contains a ``summary`` component that indicates the
        ``totalRequests`` that were part of the original batch request and ``successfulRequests``\ i.e.
        queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a ``batchItems``
        array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The
        ``batchItems`` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent
        in the batch request. Each item in ``batchItems`` contains ``statusCode`` and ``response``
        fields. Each ``response`` in ``batchItems`` is of one of the following types:


        *
          `\ ``SearchAddressResponse``
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchfuzzy#SearchAddressResponse>`_ - If
        the query completed successfully.

        *
          ``Error`` - If the query failed. The response will contain a ``code`` and a ``message`` in
        this case.

        Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 *successful* and 1 *failed* result:

        .. code-block:: json

           {
               "summary": {
                   "successfulRequests": 2,
                   "totalRequests": 3

                                   "address": {

        """**Search Fuzzy Batch API**

        **Applies to**\ : S1 pricing tier.

        The Search Address Batch API sends batches of queries to `Search Fuzzy API
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchfuzzy>`_ using just a single API
        call. You can call Search Address Fuzzy Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or
        synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync
        API up to **100** queries.

        Submit Synchronous Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a
        request, it will respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no
        possibility to retrieve the results later. The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a
        408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The number of batch items is limited
        to **100** for this API.

        .. code-block::

           POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&subscription-
        key={subscription-key}

        Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search
        requests


        * It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
        * The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
        * The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.

        When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response
        code along a redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be
        checked periodically until the response data or error information is available.
        The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response
        if used after the expiration period.

        Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running request. Here's a typical
        sequence of operations:


        #. Client sends a Search Address Batch ``POST`` request to Azure Maps
        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Batch request has been accepted.

              HTTP ``Error`` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a
        ``400 Bad Request`` or any other ``Error`` status code.


        #.
           If the batch request was accepted successfully, the ``Location`` header in the response
        contains the URL to download the results of the batch request.
            This status URI looks like following:

        .. code-block::

               GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-
        version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}


        #. Client issues a ``GET`` request on the *download URL* obtained in Step 3 to download the
        batch results.

        POST Body for Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        To send the *search fuzzy* queries you will use a ``POST`` request where the request body will
        contain the ``batchItems`` array in ``json`` format and the ``Content-Type`` header will be set
        to ``application/json``. Here's a sample request body containing 5 *search fuzzy* queries:

        .. code-block:: json

           {
               "batchItems": [
                   {"query": "?query=atm&lat=47.639769&lon=-122.128362&radius=5000&limit=5"},
                   {"query": "?query=Statue Of Liberty&limit=2"},
                   {"query": "?query=Starbucks&lat=47.639769&lon=-122.128362&radius=5000"},
                   {"query": "?query=Space Needle"},
                   {"query": "?query=pizza&limit=10"}
               ]
           }

        A *search fuzzy* query in a batch is just a partial URL *without* the protocol, base URL, path,
        api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported *search fuzzy* `URI
        parameters <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchfuzzy#uri-parameters>`_.
        The string values in the *search fuzzy* query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should
        be escaped with ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.

        The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100**
        queries, and the batch should contain at least **1** query.

        Download Asynchronous Batch Results
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        To download the async batch results you will issue a ``GET`` request to the batch download
        endpoint. This *download URL* can be obtained from the ``Location`` header of a successful
        ``POST`` batch request and looks like the following:

        .. code-block::

           https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&subscription-
        key={subscription-key}

        Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:


        #. Client sends a ``GET`` request using the *download URL*.
        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please
        try again in some time.

              HTTP ``200 OK`` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all
        the batch results.


        Batch Response Model
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results
        of an async batch request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the
        batch response. This batch response contains a ``summary`` component that indicates the
        ``totalRequests`` that were part of the original batch request and ``successfulRequests``\ i.e.
        queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a ``batchItems``
        array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The
        ``batchItems`` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent
        in the batch request. Each item in ``batchItems`` contains ``statusCode`` and ``response``
        fields. Each ``response`` in ``batchItems`` is of one of the following types:


        *
          `\ ``SearchAddressResponse``
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchfuzzy#SearchAddressResponse>`_ - If
        the query completed successfully.

        *
          ``Error`` - If the query failed. The response will contain a ``code`` and a ``message`` in
        this case.

        Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 *successful* and 1 *failed* result:

        .. code-block:: json

           {
               "summary": {
                   "successfulRequests": 2,
                   "totalRequests": 3
               },

                   {

                       {
                           "summary": {
                               "query": "atm"

                                   "address": {

                           ]
                       }
                   },
                   {

        """**Search Fuzzy Batch API**

        **Applies to**\ : S1 pricing tier.

        The Search Address Batch API sends batches of queries to `Search Fuzzy API
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchfuzzy>`_ using just a single API
        call. You can call Search Address Fuzzy Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or
        synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync
        API up to **100** queries.

        Submit Synchronous Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a
        request, it will respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no
        possibility to retrieve the results later. The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a
        408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The number of batch items is limited
        to **100** for this API.

        .. code-block::

           POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&subscription-
        key={subscription-key}

        Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search
        requests


        * It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
        * The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
        * The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.

        When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response
        code along a redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be
        checked periodically until the response data or error information is available.
        The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response
        if used after the expiration period.

        Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running request. Here's a typical
        sequence of operations:


        #. Client sends a Search Address Batch ``POST`` request to Azure Maps
        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Batch request has been accepted.

              HTTP ``Error`` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a
        ``400 Bad Request`` or any other ``Error`` status code.


        #.
           If the batch request was accepted successfully, the ``Location`` header in the response
        contains the URL to download the results of the batch request.
            This status URI looks like following:

        .. code-block::

               GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-
        version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}


        #. Client issues a ``GET`` request on the *download URL* obtained in Step 3 to download the
        batch results.

        POST Body for Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        To send the *search fuzzy* queries you will use a ``POST`` request where the request body will
        contain the ``batchItems`` array in ``json`` format and the ``Content-Type`` header will be set
        to ``application/json``. Here's a sample request body containing 5 *search fuzzy* queries:

        .. code-block:: json

           {
               "batchItems": [
                   {"query": "?query=atm&lat=47.639769&lon=-122.128362&radius=5000&limit=5"},
                   {"query": "?query=Statue Of Liberty&limit=2"},
                   {"query": "?query=Starbucks&lat=47.639769&lon=-122.128362&radius=5000"},
                   {"query": "?query=Space Needle"},
                   {"query": "?query=pizza&limit=10"}
               ]
           }

        A *search fuzzy* query in a batch is just a partial URL *without* the protocol, base URL, path,
        api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported *search fuzzy* `URI
        parameters <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchfuzzy#uri-parameters>`_.
        The string values in the *search fuzzy* query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should
        be escaped with ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.

        The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100**
        queries, and the batch should contain at least **1** query.

        Download Asynchronous Batch Results
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        To download the async batch results you will issue a ``GET`` request to the batch download
        endpoint. This *download URL* can be obtained from the ``Location`` header of a successful
        ``POST`` batch request and looks like the following:

        .. code-block::

           https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&subscription-
        key={subscription-key}

        Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:


        #. Client sends a ``GET`` request using the *download URL*.
        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please
        try again in some time.

              HTTP ``200 OK`` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all
        the batch results.


        Batch Response Model
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results
        of an async batch request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the
        batch response. This batch response contains a ``summary`` component that indicates the
        ``totalRequests`` that were part of the original batch request and ``successfulRequests``\ i.e.
        queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a ``batchItems``
        array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The
        ``batchItems`` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent
        in the batch request. Each item in ``batchItems`` contains ``statusCode`` and ``response``
        fields. Each ``response`` in ``batchItems`` is of one of the following types:


        *
          `\ ``SearchAddressResponse``
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchfuzzy#SearchAddressResponse>`_ - If
        the query completed successfully.

        *
          ``Error`` - If the query failed. The response will contain a ``code`` and a ``message`` in
        this case.

        Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 *successful* and 1 *failed* result:

        .. code-block:: json

           {
               "summary": {
                   "successfulRequests": 2,
                   "totalRequests": 3

                   {

                       {

                               "query": "atm"

        queries, and the batch should contain at least **1** query.

        Download Asynchronous Batch Results
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        To download the async batch results you will issue a ``GET`` request to the batch download
        endpoint. This *download URL* can be obtained from the ``Location`` header of a successful
        ``POST`` batch request and looks like the following:

        .. code-block::

           https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&subscription-
        key={subscription-key}

        Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:


        #. Client sends a ``GET`` request using the *download URL*.
        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please
        try again in some time.

              HTTP ``200 OK`` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all
        the batch results.


        Batch Response Model
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results
        of an async batch request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the
        batch response. This batch response contains a ``summary`` component that indicates the
        ``totalRequests`` that were part of the original batch request and ``successfulRequests``\ i.e.
        queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a ``batchItems``
        array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The
        ``batchItems`` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent
        in the batch request. Each item in ``batchItems`` contains ``statusCode`` and ``response``
        fields. Each ``response`` in ``batchItems`` is of one of the following types:


        *
          `\ ``SearchAddressResponse``
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchaddress#SearchAddressResponse>`_ - If
        the query completed successfully.

        *
          ``Error`` - If the query failed. The response will contain a ``code`` and a ``message`` in
        this case.

        Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 *successful* and 1 *failed* result:

        .. code-block:: json

           {
               "summary": {
                   "successfulRequests": 2,
                   "totalRequests": 3
               },

                   {

        """**Search Address Batch API**

        **Applies to**\ : S1 pricing tier.

        The Search Address Batch API sends batches of queries to `Search Address API
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchaddress>`_ using just a single API
        call. You can call Search Address Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or
        synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync
        API up to **100** queries.

        Submit Synchronous Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a
        request, it will respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no
        possibility to retrieve the results later. The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a
        408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The number of batch items is limited
        to **100** for this API.

        .. code-block::

           POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/sync/json?api-
        version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}

        Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search
        requests


        * It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
        * The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
        * The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.

        When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response
        code along a redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be
        checked periodically until the response data or error information is available.
        The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response
        if used after the expiration period.

        Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running request. Here's a typical
        sequence of operations:


        #. Client sends a Search Address Batch ``POST`` request to Azure Maps
        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Batch request has been accepted.

              HTTP ``Error`` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a
        ``400 Bad Request`` or any other ``Error`` status code.


        #.
           If the batch request was accepted successfully, the ``Location`` header in the response
        contains the URL to download the results of the batch request.
            This status URI looks like following:

        .. code-block::

               GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-
        version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}


        #. Client issues a ``GET`` request on the *download URL* obtained in Step 3 to download the
        batch results.

        POST Body for Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        To send the *search address* queries you will use a ``POST`` request where the request body
        will contain the ``batchItems`` array in ``json`` format and the ``Content-Type`` header will
        be set to ``application/json``. Here's a sample request body containing 5 *search address*
        queries:

        .. code-block:: json

           {
               "batchItems": [
                   {"query": "?query=400 Broad St, Seattle, WA 98109&limit=3"},
                   {"query": "?query=One, Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052&limit=3"},
                   {"query": "?query=350 5th Ave, New York, NY 10118&limit=1"},
                   {"query": "?query=Pike Pl, Seattle, WA
        98101&lat=47.610970&lon=-122.342469&radius=1000"},
                   {"query": "?query=Champ de Mars, 5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris,
        France&limit=1"}
               ]
           }

        A *search address* query in a batch is just a partial URL *without* the protocol, base URL,
        path, api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported *search address*
        `URI parameters <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchaddress#uri-
        parameters>`_. The string values in the *search address* query must be properly escaped (e.g. "
        character should be escaped with ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.

        The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100**
        queries, and the batch should contain at least **1** query.

        Download Asynchronous Batch Results
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        To download the async batch results you will issue a ``GET`` request to the batch download
        endpoint. This *download URL* can be obtained from the ``Location`` header of a successful
        ``POST`` batch request and looks like the following:

        .. code-block::

           https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&subscription-
        key={subscription-key}

        Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:


        #. Client sends a ``GET`` request using the *download URL*.
        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please
        try again in some time.

              HTTP ``200 OK`` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all
        the batch results.


        Batch Response Model
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results
        of an async batch request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the
        batch response. This batch response contains a ``summary`` component that indicates the
        ``totalRequests`` that were part of the original batch request and ``successfulRequests``\ i.e.
        queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a ``batchItems``
        array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The
        ``batchItems`` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent
        in the batch request. Each item in ``batchItems`` contains ``statusCode`` and ``response``
        fields. Each ``response`` in ``batchItems`` is of one of the following types:


        *
          `\ ``SearchAddressResponse``
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchaddress#SearchAddressResponse>`_ - If
        the query completed successfully.

        *
          ``Error`` - If the query failed. The response will contain a ``code`` and a ``message`` in
        this case.

        Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 *successful* and 1 *failed* result:

        .. code-block:: json

           {
               "summary": {
                   "successfulRequests": 2,
                   "totalRequests": 3
               },
               "batchItems": [
                   {
                       "statusCode": 200,
                       "response":
                       {
                           "summary": {
                               "query": "one microsoft way redmond wa 98052"
                           },
                           "results": [
                               {
                                   "position": {

        """**Search Address Batch API**

        **Applies to**\ : S1 pricing tier.

        The Search Address Batch API sends batches of queries to `Search Address API
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchaddress>`_ using just a single API
        call. You can call Search Address Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or
        synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync
        API up to **100** queries.

        Submit Synchronous Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a
        request, it will respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no
        possibility to retrieve the results later. The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a
        408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The number of batch items is limited
        to **100** for this API.

        .. code-block::

           POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/sync/json?api-
        version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}

        Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search
        requests


        * It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
        * The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
        * The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.

        When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response
        code along a redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be
        checked periodically until the response data or error information is available.
        The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response
        if used after the expiration period.

        Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running request. Here's a typical
        sequence of operations:


        #. Client sends a Search Address Batch ``POST`` request to Azure Maps
        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Batch request has been accepted.

              HTTP ``Error`` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a
        ``400 Bad Request`` or any other ``Error`` status code.


        #.
           If the batch request was accepted successfully, the ``Location`` header in the response
        contains the URL to download the results of the batch request.
            This status URI looks like following:

        .. code-block::

               GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-
        version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}


        #. Client issues a ``GET`` request on the *download URL* obtained in Step 3 to download the
        batch results.

        POST Body for Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        To send the *search address* queries you will use a ``POST`` request where the request body
        will contain the ``batchItems`` array in ``json`` format and the ``Content-Type`` header will
        be set to ``application/json``. Here's a sample request body containing 5 *search address*
        queries:

        .. code-block:: json

           {
               "batchItems": [
                   {"query": "?query=400 Broad St, Seattle, WA 98109&limit=3"},
                   {"query": "?query=One, Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052&limit=3"},
                   {"query": "?query=350 5th Ave, New York, NY 10118&limit=1"},
                   {"query": "?query=Pike Pl, Seattle, WA
        98101&lat=47.610970&lon=-122.342469&radius=1000"},
                   {"query": "?query=Champ de Mars, 5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris,
        France&limit=1"}
               ]
           }

        A *search address* query in a batch is just a partial URL *without* the protocol, base URL,
        path, api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported *search address*
        `URI parameters <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchaddress#uri-
        parameters>`_. The string values in the *search address* query must be properly escaped (e.g. "
        character should be escaped with ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.

        The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100**
        queries, and the batch should contain at least **1** query.

        Download Asynchronous Batch Results
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        To download the async batch results you will issue a ``GET`` request to the batch download
        endpoint. This *download URL* can be obtained from the ``Location`` header of a successful
        ``POST`` batch request and looks like the following:

        .. code-block::

           https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&subscription-
        key={subscription-key}

        Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:


        #. Client sends a ``GET`` request using the *download URL*.
        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please
        try again in some time.

              HTTP ``200 OK`` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all
        the batch results.


        Batch Response Model
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results
        of an async batch request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the
        batch response. This batch response contains a ``summary`` component that indicates the
        ``totalRequests`` that were part of the original batch request and ``successfulRequests``\ i.e.
        queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a ``batchItems``
        array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The
        ``batchItems`` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent
        in the batch request. Each item in ``batchItems`` contains ``statusCode`` and ``response``
        fields. Each ``response`` in ``batchItems`` is of one of the following types:


        *
          `\ ``SearchAddressResponse``
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchaddress#SearchAddressResponse>`_ - If
        the query completed successfully.

        *
          ``Error`` - If the query failed. The response will contain a ``code`` and a ``message`` in
        this case.

        Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 *successful* and 1 *failed* result:

        .. code-block:: json

           {
               "summary": {
                   "successfulRequests": 2,
                   "totalRequests": 3
               },
               "batchItems": [
                   {
                       "statusCode": 200,

                       {
                           "summary": {
                               "query": "one microsoft way redmond wa 98052"
                           },

        **Applies to**\ : S1 pricing tier.

        The Search Address Batch API sends batches of queries to `Search Address Reverse API
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchaddressreverse>`_ using just a single
        API call. You can call Search Address Reverse Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or

        API up to **100** queries.

        Submit Synchronous Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a
        request, it will respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no
        possibility to retrieve the results later. The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a
        408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The number of batch items is limited
        to **100** for this API.

        .. code-block::

           POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/sync/json?api-
        version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}

        Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search
        requests


        * It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
        * The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
        * The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.

        When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response
        code along a redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be
        checked periodically until the response data or error information is available.
        The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response
        if used after the expiration period.

        Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running request. Here's a typical
        sequence of operations:


        #. Client sends a Search Address Batch ``POST`` request to Azure Maps
        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Batch request has been accepted.

              HTTP ``Error`` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a
        ``400 Bad Request`` or any other ``Error`` status code.


        #.
           If the batch request was accepted successfully, the ``Location`` header in the response
        contains the URL to download the results of the batch request.
            This status URI looks like following:

        .. code-block::

               GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-
        version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}


        #. Client issues a ``GET`` request on the *download URL* obtained in Step 3 to download the
        batch results.

        POST Body for Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        To send the *search address reverse* queries you will use a ``POST`` request where the request
        body will contain the ``batchItems`` array in ``json`` format and the ``Content-Type`` header
        will be set to ``application/json``. Here's a sample request body containing 5 *search address
        reverse* queries:

        .. code-block:: json

           {
               "batchItems": [
                   {"query": "?query=48.858561,2.294911"},
                   {"query": "?query=47.639765,-122.127896&radius=5000&limit=2"},
                   {"query": "?query=47.621028,-122.348170"},
                   {"query": "?query=43.722990,10.396695"},
                   {"query": "?query=40.750958,-73.982336"}
               ]
           }

        A *search address reverse* query in a batch is just a partial URL *without* the protocol, base
        URL, path, api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported *search address
        reverse* `URI parameters
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchaddressreverse#uri-parameters>`_. The
        string values in the *search address reverse* query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character
        should be escaped with ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.

        The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100**
        queries, and the batch should contain at least **1** query.

        Download Asynchronous Batch Results
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        To download the async batch results you will issue a ``GET`` request to the batch download
        endpoint. This *download URL* can be obtained from the ``Location`` header of a successful
        ``POST`` batch request and looks like the following:

        .. code-block::

           https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-
        version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}

        Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:


        #. Client sends a ``GET`` request using the *download URL*.
        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please
        try again in some time.

              HTTP ``200 OK`` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all
        the batch results.


        Batch Response Model
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results
        of an async batch request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the
        batch response. This batch response contains a ``summary`` component that indicates the
        ``totalRequests`` that were part of the original batch request and ``successfulRequests``\ i.e.
        queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a ``batchItems``
        array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The
        ``batchItems`` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent
        in the batch request. Each item in ``batchItems`` contains ``statusCode`` and ``response``
        fields. Each ``response`` in ``batchItems`` is of one of the following types:


        *
          `\ ``SearchAddressReverseResponse``
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchaddressreverse#searchaddressreverseresponse>`_
        - If the query completed successfully.

        *
          ``Error`` - If the query failed. The response will contain a ``code`` and a ``message`` in
        this case.

        Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 *successful* and 1 *failed* result:

        .. code-block:: json

           {
               "summary": {
                   "successfulRequests": 2,

        requests


        * It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
        * The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
        * The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.

        When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response
        code along a redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be
        checked periodically until the response data or error information is available.
        The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response
        if used after the expiration period.

        Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running request. Here's a typical
        sequence of operations:


        #. Client sends a Search Address Batch ``POST`` request to Azure Maps
        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Batch request has been accepted.

              HTTP ``Error`` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a
        ``400 Bad Request`` or any other ``Error`` status code.


        #.
           If the batch request was accepted successfully, the ``Location`` header in the response
        contains the URL to download the results of the batch request.
            This status URI looks like following:

        .. code-block::

               GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-
        version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}


        #. Client issues a ``GET`` request on the *download URL* obtained in Step 3 to download the
        batch results.

        POST Body for Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        To send the *search address reverse* queries you will use a ``POST`` request where the request
        body will contain the ``batchItems`` array in ``json`` format and the ``Content-Type`` header
        will be set to ``application/json``. Here's a sample request body containing 5 *search address
        reverse* queries:

        .. code-block:: json

           {
               "batchItems": [
                   {"query": "?query=48.858561,2.294911"},
                   {"query": "?query=47.639765,-122.127896&radius=5000&limit=2"},
                   {"query": "?query=47.621028,-122.348170"},
                   {"query": "?query=43.722990,10.396695"},
                   {"query": "?query=40.750958,-73.982336"}
               ]
           }

        A *search address reverse* query in a batch is just a partial URL *without* the protocol, base
        URL, path, api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported *search address
        reverse* `URI parameters
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchaddressreverse#uri-parameters>`_. The
        string values in the *search address reverse* query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character
        should be escaped with ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.

        The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100**
        queries, and the batch should contain at least **1** query.

        Download Asynchronous Batch Results
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        To download the async batch results you will issue a ``GET`` request to the batch download
        endpoint. This *download URL* can be obtained from the ``Location`` header of a successful
        ``POST`` batch request and looks like the following:

        .. code-block::

           https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-
        version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}

        Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:


        #. Client sends a ``GET`` request using the *download URL*.
        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please
        try again in some time.

              HTTP ``200 OK`` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all
        the batch results.


        Batch Response Model
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results
        of an async batch request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the
        batch response. This batch response contains a ``summary`` component that indicates the
        ``totalRequests`` that were part of the original batch request and ``successfulRequests``\ i.e.
        queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a ``batchItems``
        array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The
        ``batchItems`` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent
        in the batch request. Each item in ``batchItems`` contains ``statusCode`` and ``response``
        fields. Each ``response`` in ``batchItems`` is of one of the following types:


        *
          `\ ``SearchAddressReverseResponse``
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchaddressreverse#searchaddressreverseresponse>`_
        - If the query completed successfully.

        *
          ``Error`` - If the query failed. The response will contain a ``code`` and a ``message`` in
        this case.

        Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 *successful* and 1 *failed* result:

        .. code-block:: json

           {
               "summary": {
                   "successfulRequests": 2,
                   "totalRequests": 3
               },
               "batchItems": [
                   {

        """**Search Address Reverse Batch API**

        **Applies to**\ : S1 pricing tier.

        The Search Address Batch API sends batches of queries to `Search Address Reverse API
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchaddressreverse>`_ using just a single
        API call. You can call Search Address Reverse Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or
        synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync
        API up to **100** queries.

        Submit Synchronous Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a
        request, it will respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no
        possibility to retrieve the results later. The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a
        408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The number of batch items is limited
        to **100** for this API.

        .. code-block::

        version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}

        Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search
        requests


        * It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
        * The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
        * The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.

        When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response
        code along a redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be
        checked periodically until the response data or error information is available.
        The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response
        if used after the expiration period.

        Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running request. Here's a typical
        sequence of operations:


        #. Client sends a Search Address Batch ``POST`` request to Azure Maps
        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Batch request has been accepted.

              HTTP ``Error`` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a
        ``400 Bad Request`` or any other ``Error`` status code.


        #.
           If the batch request was accepted successfully, the ``Location`` header in the response
        contains the URL to download the results of the batch request.
            This status URI looks like following:

        .. code-block::

               GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-
        version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}


        #. Client issues a ``GET`` request on the *download URL* obtained in Step 3 to download the
        batch results.

        POST Body for Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        To send the *search address reverse* queries you will use a ``POST`` request where the request
        body will contain the ``batchItems`` array in ``json`` format and the ``Content-Type`` header
        will be set to ``application/json``. Here's a sample request body containing 5 *search address
        reverse* queries:

        .. code-block:: json

           {
               "batchItems": [
                   {"query": "?query=48.858561,2.294911"},
                   {"query": "?query=47.639765,-122.127896&radius=5000&limit=2"},
                   {"query": "?query=47.621028,-122.348170"},
                   {"query": "?query=43.722990,10.396695"},
                   {"query": "?query=40.750958,-73.982336"}
               ]
           }

        A *search address reverse* query in a batch is just a partial URL *without* the protocol, base
        URL, path, api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported *search address
        reverse* `URI parameters
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchaddressreverse#uri-parameters>`_. The
        string values in the *search address reverse* query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character
        should be escaped with ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.

        The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100**
        queries, and the batch should contain at least **1** query.

        Download Asynchronous Batch Results
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        To download the async batch results you will issue a ``GET`` request to the batch download
        endpoint. This *download URL* can be obtained from the ``Location`` header of a successful
        ``POST`` batch request and looks like the following:

        .. code-block::

        Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:


        #. Client sends a ``GET`` request using the *download URL*.
        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please
        try again in some time.

              HTTP ``200 OK`` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all
        the batch results.


        Batch Response Model
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results
        of an async batch request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the
        batch response. This batch response contains a ``summary`` component that indicates the
        ``totalRequests`` that were part of the original batch request and ``successfulRequests``\ i.e.
        queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a ``batchItems``
        array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The
        ``batchItems`` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent
        in the batch request. Each item in ``batchItems`` contains ``statusCode`` and ``response``
        fields. Each ``response`` in ``batchItems`` is of one of the following types:


        *
          `\ ``SearchAddressReverseResponse``
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchaddressreverse#searchaddressreverseresponse>`_
        - If the query completed successfully.

        *
          ``Error`` - If the query failed. The response will contain a ``code`` and a ``message`` in
        this case.

        Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 *successful* and 1 *failed* result:

        .. code-block:: json

           {
               "summary": {
                   "successfulRequests": 2,
