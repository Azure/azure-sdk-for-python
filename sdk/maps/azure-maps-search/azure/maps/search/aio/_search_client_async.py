        The ``Get Geocoding`` API is an HTTP ``GET`` request that returns the latitude and longitude
        coordinates of the location being searched.

        In many cases, the complete search service might be too much, for instance if you are only
        interested in traditional geocoding. Search can also be accessed for address look up
        exclusively. The geocoding is performed by hitting the geocoding endpoint with just the address
        or partial address in question. The geocoding search index will be queried for everything above
        the street level data. No Point of Interest (POIs) will be returned. Note that the geocoder is
        very tolerant of typos and incomplete addresses. It will also handle everything from exact
        street addresses or street or intersections as well as higher level geographies such as city
        centers, counties and states. The response also returns detailed address properties such as
        street, postal code, municipality, and country/region information.

        Submit Synchronous Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a

        possibility to retrieve the results later. The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a

        POST Body for Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        To send the *geocoding* queries you will use a ``POST`` request where the request body will
        contain the ``batchItems`` array in ``json`` format and the ``Content-Type`` header will be set
        to ``application/json``. Here's a sample request body containing 2 *geocoding* queries:

        The batch should contain at least **1** query.

        Batch Response Model
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The batch response contains a ``summary`` component that indicates the ``totalRequests`` that
        were part of the original batch request and ``successfulRequests`` i.e. queries which were
        executed successfully. The batch response also includes a ``batchItems`` array which contains a
        response for each and every query in the batch request. The ``batchItems`` will contain the
        results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item
        is of one of the following types:


        * ``GeocodingResponse`` - If the query completed successfully.
