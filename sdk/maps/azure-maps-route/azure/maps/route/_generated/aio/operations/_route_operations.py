        The Matrix Routing service allows calculation of a matrix of route summaries for a set of
        routes defined by origin and destination locations by using an asynchronous (async) or
        synchronous (sync) POST request. For every given origin, the service calculates the cost of
        routing from that origin to every given destination. The set of origins and the set of
        destinations can be thought of as the column and row headers of a table and each cell in the
        table contains the costs of routing from the origin to the destination for that cell. As an
        example, let's say a food delivery company has 20 drivers and they need to find the closest
        driver to pick up the delivery from the restaurant. To solve this use case, they can call
        Matrix Route API.

        For each route, the travel times and distances are returned. You can use the computed costs to
        determine which detailed routes to calculate using the Route Directions API.

        The maximum size of a matrix for async request is **700** and for sync request it's **100**
        (the number of origins multiplied by the number of destinations).

        Submit Synchronous Route Matrix Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        If your scenario requires synchronous requests and the maximum size of the matrix is less than
        or equal to 100, you might want to make synchronous request. The maximum size of a matrix for
        this API is **100** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of destinations). With that
        constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 10x10, 6x8, 9x8 (it does not
        need to be square).

        .. code-block::

           POST
        https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/sync/json?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}

        Submit Asynchronous Route Matrix Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex routing
        requests. When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202
        response code along a redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL
        should be checked periodically until the response data or error information is available. If
        ``waitForResults`` parameter in the request is set to true, user will get a 200 response if the
        request is finished under 120 seconds.

        The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **700** (the number of origins multiplied by the
        number of destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions
        are: 50x10, 10x10, 28x25. 10x70 (it does not need to be square).

        The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response
        if used after the expiration period.

        .. code-block::

           POST
        https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/json?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}

        Here's a typical sequence of asynchronous operations:


        #.
           Client sends a Route Matrix POST request to Azure Maps

        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` -  Route Matrix request has been accepted.

              HTTP ``Error`` - There was an error processing your Route Matrix request. This could
        either be a 400 Bad Request or any other Error status code.



        #.
           If the Matrix Route request was accepted successfully, the Location header in the response
        contains the URL to download the results of the request. This status URI looks like the
        following:

           .. code-block::

               GET
        https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}


        #. Client issues a GET request on the download URL obtained in Step 3 to download the results

        Download Sync Results
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        When you make a POST request for Route Matrix Sync API, the service returns 200 response code
        for successful request and a response array. The response body will contain the data and there
        will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.

        Download Async Results
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        When a request issues a ``202 Accepted`` response, the request is being processed using our
        async pipeline. You will be given a URL to check the progress of your  async request in the
        location header of the response. This status URI looks like the following:

        .. code-block::

             GET
        https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}

        The URL provided by the location header will return the following responses when a ``GET``
        request is issued.

        ..

           HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Matrix request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try
        again in some time.

           HTTP ``200 OK`` - Matrix request successfully processed. The response body contains all of
        the results.

         the input parameters. The minimum and the maximum cell count supported are 1 and **700** for
         async and **100** for sync respectively. For example, it can be 35 origins and 20 destinations
         or 25 origins and 25 destinations for async API.
        :type post_route_matrix_request_body: ~azure.maps.route.models.PostRouteMatrixRequestBody
        :param wait_for_results: Boolean to indicate whether to execute the request synchronously. If
         set to true, user will get a 200 response if the request is finished under 120 seconds.
         Otherwise, user will get a 202 response right away. Please refer to the API description for
         more details on 202 response. **Supported only for async request**.

        :param compute_travel_time_for: Specifies whether to return additional travel times using

         during route planning.

         *
           A non-zero value may be overridden during route planning. For example, the current traffic
         flow is 60 km/hour. If the vehicle  maximum speed is set to 50 km/hour, the routing engine will
         consider 60 km/hour as this is the current situation.  If the maximum speed of the vehicle is
         provided as 80 km/hour but the current traffic flow is 60 km/hour, then routing engine will
         again use 60 km/hour.

        The Matrix Routing service allows calculation of a matrix of route summaries for a set of
        routes defined by origin and destination locations by using an asynchronous (async) or
        synchronous (sync) POST request. For every given origin, the service calculates the cost of
        routing from that origin to every given destination. The set of origins and the set of
        destinations can be thought of as the column and row headers of a table and each cell in the
        table contains the costs of routing from the origin to the destination for that cell. As an
        example, let's say a food delivery company has 20 drivers and they need to find the closest
        driver to pick up the delivery from the restaurant. To solve this use case, they can call
        Matrix Route API.

        For each route, the travel times and distances are returned. You can use the computed costs to
        determine which detailed routes to calculate using the Route Directions API.

        The maximum size of a matrix for async request is **700** and for sync request it's **100**
        (the number of origins multiplied by the number of destinations).

        Submit Synchronous Route Matrix Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        If your scenario requires synchronous requests and the maximum size of the matrix is less than
        or equal to 100, you might want to make synchronous request. The maximum size of a matrix for
        this API is **100** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of destinations). With that
        constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 10x10, 6x8, 9x8 (it does not
        need to be square).

        .. code-block::

           POST
        https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/sync/json?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}

        Submit Asynchronous Route Matrix Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex routing
        requests. When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202
        response code along a redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL
        should be checked periodically until the response data or error information is available. If
        ``waitForResults`` parameter in the request is set to true, user will get a 200 response if the
        request is finished under 120 seconds.

        The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **700** (the number of origins multiplied by the
        number of destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions
        are: 50x10, 10x10, 28x25. 10x70 (it does not need to be square).

        The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response
        if used after the expiration period.

        .. code-block::

           POST
        https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/json?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}

        Here's a typical sequence of asynchronous operations:


        #.
           Client sends a Route Matrix POST request to Azure Maps

        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` -  Route Matrix request has been accepted.

              HTTP ``Error`` - There was an error processing your Route Matrix request. This could
        either be a 400 Bad Request or any other Error status code.



        #.
           If the Matrix Route request was accepted successfully, the Location header in the response
        contains the URL to download the results of the request. This status URI looks like the
        following:

           .. code-block::

               GET
        https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}


        #. Client issues a GET request on the download URL obtained in Step 3 to download the results

        Download Sync Results
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        When you make a POST request for Route Matrix Sync API, the service returns 200 response code
        for successful request and a response array. The response body will contain the data and there
        will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.

        Download Async Results
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        When a request issues a ``202 Accepted`` response, the request is being processed using our
        async pipeline. You will be given a URL to check the progress of your  async request in the
        location header of the response. This status URI looks like the following:

        .. code-block::

             GET
        https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}

        The URL provided by the location header will return the following responses when a ``GET``
        request is issued.

        ..

           HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Matrix request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try
        again in some time.

        Returns  a route between an origin and a destination, passing through waypoints if they are
        specified. The route will take into account factors such as current traffic and the typical
        road speeds on the requested day of the week and time of day.

        Information returned includes the distance, estimated travel time, and a representation of the
        route geometry. Additional routing information such as optimized waypoint order or turn by turn
        instructions is also available, depending on the options selected.

        Routing service provides a set of parameters for a detailed description of vehicle-specific
        Consumption Model. Please check `Consumption Model
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/consumption-model>`_ for detailed explanation of
        the concepts and parameters involved.

        :param format: Desired format of the response. Value can be either *json* or *xml*.
        :type format: str or ~azure.maps.route.models.TextFormat
        :param query: The Coordinates through which the route is calculated, delimited by a colon.  A
         minimum of two coordinates is required.  The first one is the origin and the last is the
         destination of the route. Optional coordinates in-between act as WayPoints in the route.  You
         can pass up to 150 WayPoints.
        :type query: str
        :param max_alternatives: Number of desired alternative routes to be calculated. Default: 0,
         minimum: 0 and maximum: 5.
        :type max_alternatives: int
        :param alternative_type: Controls the optimality, with respect to the given planning criteria,
         of the calculated alternatives compared to the reference route.
        :type alternative_type: str or ~azure.maps.route.models.AlternativeRouteType
        :param min_deviation_distance: All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route
         (see section POST Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least
         this number of meters. Can only be used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationDistance
         parameter cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt.
        :type min_deviation_distance: int
        :param arrive_at: The date and time of arrival at the destination point. It must be specified
         as a dateTime. When a time zone offset is not specified it will be assumed to be that of the
         destination point. The arriveAt value must be in the future. The arriveAt parameter cannot be

        :type arrive_at: ~datetime.datetime
        :param depart_at: The date and time of departure from the origin point. Departure times apart
         from now must be specified as a dateTime. When a time zone offset is not specified, it will be
         assumed to be that of the origin point. The departAt value must be in the future in the
         date-time format (1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00).
        :type depart_at: ~datetime.datetime
        :param min_deviation_time: All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route (see
         section POST Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least this
         number of seconds. Can only be used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationTime parameter
         cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt. Default value is 0. Setting )minDeviationTime_ to
         a value greater than zero has the following consequences:


         * The origin point of the *calculateRoute* Request must be on
           (or very near) the input reference route.

           * If this is not the case, an error is returned.
           * However, the origin point does not need to be at the beginning
             of the input reference route (it can be thought of as the current
             vehicle position on the reference route).

         * The reference route, returned as the first route in the *calculateRoute*
           Response, will start at the origin point specified in the *calculateRoute*
           Request. The initial part of the input reference route up until the origin
           point will be excluded from the Response.
         * The values of *minDeviationDistance* and *minDeviationTime* determine
           how far alternative routes will be guaranteed to follow the reference
           route from the origin point onwards.
         * The route must use *departAt*.
         * The *vehicleHeading* is ignored.

         instructionsType parameter cannot be used in conjunction with routeRepresentation=none.
        :type instructions_type: str or ~azure.maps.route.models.RouteInstructionsType
        :param language: The language parameter determines the language of the guidance messages.
         Proper nouns (the names of streets, plazas, etc.) are returned in the specified  language, or
         if that is not available, they are returned in an available language  that is close to it.
         Allowed values are (a subset of) the IETF language tags. The currently supported  languages are
         listed in the `Supported languages  section

         indices. To include origin and destination in the response, please increase all the indices by
         1 to account for the origin, and then add the destination as the final index. Possible values
         are true or false. True computes a better order if possible, but is not allowed to be used in
         conjunction with maxAlternatives value greater than 0 or in conjunction with circle waypoints.

        :type vehicle_heading: int
        :param report: Specifies which data should be reported for diagnosis purposes. The only
         possible value is *effectiveSettings*. Reports the effective parameters or data used when
         calling the API. In the case of defaulted parameters the default will be reflected where the
         parameter was not specified by the caller.
        :type report: str

        :param vehicle_max_speed: Maximum speed of the vehicle in km/hour. The max speed in the vehicle
         profile is used to check whether a vehicle is allowed on motorways.


         *
           A value of 0 means that an appropriate value for the vehicle will be determined and applied
         during route planning.

         *
           A non-zero value may be overridden during route planning. For example, the current traffic
         flow is 60 km/hour. If the vehicle  maximum speed is set to 50 km/hour, the routing engine will
         consider 60 km/hour as this is the current situation.  If the maximum speed of the vehicle is
         provided as 80 km/hour but the current traffic flow is 60 km/hour, then routing engine will
         again use 60 km/hour.
        :type vehicle_max_speed: int
        :param vehicle_weight: Weight of the vehicle in kilograms.


         *
           It is mandatory if any of the *Efficiency parameters are set.

         *
           It must be strictly positive when used in the context of the Consumption Model. Weight
         restrictions are considered.

         *
           If no detailed **Consumption Model** is specified and the value of **vehicleWeight** is
         non-zero, then weight restrictions are considered.

         *
           In all other cases, this parameter is ignored.

        :param vehicle_engine_type: Engine type of the vehicle. When a detailed Consumption Model is

        :param constant_speed_consumption_in_liters_per_hundredkm: Specifies the speed-dependent
         component of consumption.

         Provided as an unordered list of colon-delimited speed & consumption-rate pairs. The list
         defines points on a consumption curve. Consumption rates for speeds not in the list are found
         as follows:


         *
           by linear interpolation, if the given speed lies in between two speeds in the list

         *
           by linear extrapolation otherwise, assuming a constant (ΔConsumption/ΔSpeed) determined by
         the nearest two points in the list

         The list must contain between 1 and 25 points (inclusive), and may not contain duplicate
         points for the same speed. If it only contains a single point, then the consumption rate of
         that point is used without further processing.

         Consumption specified for the largest speed must be greater than or equal to that of the
         penultimate largest speed. This ensures that extrapolation does not lead to negative
         consumption rates.

         Similarly, consumption values specified for the two smallest speeds in the list cannot lead to
         a negative consumption rate for any smaller speed.

         consumption rates.

         Similarly, consumption values specified for the two smallest speeds in the list cannot lead to
         a negative consumption rate for any smaller  speed.

         The valid range for the consumption values(expressed in kWh/100km) is between 0.01 and
         100000.0.

        """**Route Directions Batch API**

        **Applies to**\ : S1 pricing tier.

        The Route Directions Batch API sends batches of queries to `Route Directions API
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections>`_ using just a single
        API call. You can call Route Directions Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or
        synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API
        up to **100** queries.

        Submit Synchronous Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a
        request, it will respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no
        possibility to retrieve the results later. The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a
        408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The number of batch items is limited
        to **100** for this API.

        .. code-block::

           POST
        https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}

        Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex route
        requests


        * It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
        * The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
        * The number of batch items is limited to **700** for this API.

        When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response
        code along a redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be
        checked periodically until the response data or error information is available.
        The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response
        if used after the expiration period.

        Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running request. Here's a typical
        sequence of operations:


        #. Client sends a Route Directions Batch ``POST`` request to Azure Maps
        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Batch request has been accepted.

              HTTP ``Error`` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a
        ``400 Bad Request`` or any other ``Error`` status code.


        #.
           If the batch request was accepted successfully, the ``Location`` header in the response
        contains the URL to download the results of the batch request.
            This status URI looks like following:

        ``GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0``
        Note:- Please remember to add AUTH information (subscription-key/azure_auth - See `Security
        <#security>`_\ ) to the *status URI* before running it. :code:`<br>`


        #. Client issues a ``GET`` request on the *download URL* obtained in Step 3 to download the
        batch results.

        POST Body for Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        To send the *route directions* queries you will use a ``POST`` request where the request body
        will contain the ``batchItems`` array in ``json`` format and the ``Content-Type`` header will
        be set to ``application/json``. Here's a sample request body containing 3 *route directions*
        queries:

        .. code-block:: json

           {
               "batchItems": [
                   { "query":
        "?query=47.620659,-122.348934:47.610101,-122.342015&travelMode=bicycle&routeType=eco&traffic=false"
        },
                   { "query":
        "?query=40.759856,-73.985108:40.771136,-73.973506&travelMode=pedestrian&routeType=shortest" },
                   { "query": "?query=48.923159,-122.557362:32.621279,-116.840362" }
               ]
           }

        A *route directions* query in a batch is just a partial URL *without* the protocol, base URL,
        path, api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported *route directions*
        `URI parameters
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#uri-parameters>`_. The
        string values in the *route directions* query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should
        be escaped with ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.

        The async API allows caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100** queries,
        and the batch should contain at least **1** query.

        Download Asynchronous Batch Results
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        To download the async batch results you will issue a ``GET`` request to the batch download
        endpoint. This *download URL* can be obtained from the ``Location`` header of a successful
        ``POST`` batch request and looks like the following:

        .. code-block::

        https://atlas.microsoft.com/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}

        Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:


        #. Client sends a ``GET`` request using the *download URL*.
        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please
        try again in some time.

              HTTP ``200 OK`` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all
        the batch results.


        Batch Response Model
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results
        of an async batch request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the
        batch response. This batch response contains a ``summary`` component that indicates the
        ``totalRequests`` that were part of the original batch request and ``successfulRequests``\ i.e.
        queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a ``batchItems``
        array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The
        ``batchItems`` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent
        in the batch request. Each item in ``batchItems`` contains ``statusCode`` and ``response``
        fields. Each ``response`` in ``batchItems`` is of one of the following types:


        *
          `\ ``RouteDirectionsResponse``
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirectionsresponse>`_
        - If the query completed successfully.

        *
          ``Error`` - If the query failed. The response will contain a ``code`` and a ``message`` in
        this case.

        Here's a sample Batch Response with 1 *successful* and 1 *failed* result:

        .. code-block:: json

           {
               "summary": {
                   "successfulRequests": 1,
                   "totalRequests": 2
               },
               "batchItems": [
                   {
                       "statusCode": 200,
                       "response": {
                           "routes": [
                               {
                                   "summary": {
                                       "lengthInMeters": 1758,
                                       "travelTimeInSeconds": 387,
                                       "trafficDelayInSeconds": 0,

        """Download Asynchronous Batch Results
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        To download the async batch results you will issue a ``GET`` request to the batch download
        endpoint. This *download URL* can be obtained from the ``Location`` header of a successful
        ``POST`` batch request and looks like the following:

        .. code-block::

        https://atlas.microsoft.com/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}

        Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:


        #. Client sends a ``GET`` request using the *download URL*.
        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please
        try again in some time.

              HTTP ``200 OK`` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all
        the batch results.


        Batch Response Model
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results
        of an async batch request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the
        batch response. This batch response contains a ``summary`` component that indicates the
        ``totalRequests`` that were part of the original batch request and ``successfulRequests``\ i.e.
        queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a ``batchItems``
        array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The
        ``batchItems`` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent
        in the batch request. Each item in ``batchItems`` contains ``statusCode`` and ``response``
        fields. Each ``response`` in ``batchItems`` is of one of the following types:


        *
          `\ ``RouteDirectionsResponse``
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirectionsresponse>`_
        - If the query completed successfully.

        *
          ``Error`` - If the query failed. The response will contain a ``code`` and a ``message`` in
        this case.

        Here's a sample Batch Response with 1 *successful* and 1 *failed* result:

        .. code-block:: json

           {
               "summary": {

        """**Route Directions Batch API**

        **Applies to**\ : S1 pricing tier.

        The Route Directions Batch API sends batches of queries to `Route Directions API
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections>`_ using just a single
        API call. You can call Route Directions Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or
        synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API
        up to **100** queries.

        Submit Synchronous Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a
        request, it will respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no
        possibility to retrieve the results later. The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a
        408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The number of batch items is limited
        to **100** for this API.

        .. code-block::

           POST
        https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}

        Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex route
        requests


        * It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
        * The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
        * The number of batch items is limited to **700** for this API.

        When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response
        code along a redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be
        checked periodically until the response data or error information is available.
        The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response
        if used after the expiration period.

        Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running request. Here's a typical
        sequence of operations:


        #. Client sends a Route Directions Batch ``POST`` request to Azure Maps
        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Batch request has been accepted.

              HTTP ``Error`` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a
        ``400 Bad Request`` or any other ``Error`` status code.


        #.
           If the batch request was accepted successfully, the ``Location`` header in the response
        contains the URL to download the results of the batch request.
            This status URI looks like following:

        ``GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0``
        Note:- Please remember to add AUTH information (subscription-key/azure_auth - See `Security
        <#security>`_\ ) to the *status URI* before running it. :code:`<br>`


        #. Client issues a ``GET`` request on the *download URL* obtained in Step 3 to download the
        batch results.

        POST Body for Batch Request
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        To send the *route directions* queries you will use a ``POST`` request where the request body
        will contain the ``batchItems`` array in ``json`` format and the ``Content-Type`` header will
        be set to ``application/json``. Here's a sample request body containing 3 *route directions*
        queries:

        .. code-block:: json

           {
               "batchItems": [
                   { "query":
        "?query=47.620659,-122.348934:47.610101,-122.342015&travelMode=bicycle&routeType=eco&traffic=false"
        },
                   { "query":
        "?query=40.759856,-73.985108:40.771136,-73.973506&travelMode=pedestrian&routeType=shortest" },
                   { "query": "?query=48.923159,-122.557362:32.621279,-116.840362" }
               ]
           }

        A *route directions* query in a batch is just a partial URL *without* the protocol, base URL,
        path, api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported *route directions*
        `URI parameters
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#uri-parameters>`_. The
        string values in the *route directions* query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should
        be escaped with ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.

        The async API allows caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100** queries,
        and the batch should contain at least **1** query.

        Download Asynchronous Batch Results
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        To download the async batch results you will issue a ``GET`` request to the batch download
        endpoint. This *download URL* can be obtained from the ``Location`` header of a successful
        ``POST`` batch request and looks like the following:

        .. code-block::

        https://atlas.microsoft.com/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}

        Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:


        #. Client sends a ``GET`` request using the *download URL*.
        #.
           The server will respond with one of the following:

           ..

              HTTP ``202 Accepted`` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please
        try again in some time.

              HTTP ``200 OK`` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all
        the batch results.


        Batch Response Model
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results
        of an async batch request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the
        batch response. This batch response contains a ``summary`` component that indicates the
        ``totalRequests`` that were part of the original batch request and ``successfulRequests``\ i.e.
        queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a ``batchItems``
        array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The
        ``batchItems`` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent
        in the batch request. Each item in ``batchItems`` contains ``statusCode`` and ``response``
        fields. Each ``response`` in ``batchItems`` is of one of the following types:


        *
          `\ ``RouteDirectionsResponse``
        <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirectionsresponse>`_
        - If the query completed successfully.

        *
          ``Error`` - If the query failed. The response will contain a ``code`` and a ``message`` in
        this case.

        Here's a sample Batch Response with 1 *successful* and 1 *failed* result:

        .. code-block:: json

           {
               "summary": {
                   "successfulRequests": 1,
                   "totalRequests": 2
               },
               "batchItems": [
                   {
