# pymmh3 was written by Fredrik Kihlander, and is placed in the public
# domain. The author hereby disclaims copyright to this source code.
#
# pure python implementation of the murmur3 hash algorithm
#
# https://code.google.com/p/smhasher/wiki/MurmurHash3
#
# This was written for the times when you do not want to compile c-code and install modules,
# and you only want a drop-in murmur3 implementation.
#
# As this is purely python it is FAR from performant and if performance is anything that is needed
# a proper c-module is suggested!
#
# This module is written to have the same format as mmh3 python package found here for simple conversions:
#
# https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mmh3/2.0
