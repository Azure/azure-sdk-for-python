### 4.3.0b3 (2022-03-10)

>[WARNING]
>The default `Session` consistency bugfix will impact customers whose database accounts have a `Bounded Staleness` or `Strong`
> consistency level, and were previously not sending `Session` as a consistency_level parameter when initializing
> their clients.
> Default consistency level for the sync and async clients is no longer "Session" and will instead be set to the 
  consistency level of the user's cosmos account setting on initialization if not passed during client initialization. 
> Please see [Consistency Levels in Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels) 
> for more details on consistency levels, or the README section on this change [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/cosmos/azure-cosmos#note-on-client-consistency-levels).

#### Features Added
- Added new **provisional** `max_integrated_cache_staleness_in_ms` parameter to read item and query items APIs in order
  to make use of the **preview** CosmosDB integrated cache functionality [See PR #22946](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/22946).
  Please see [Azure Cosmos DB integrated cache](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/integrated-cache) for more details.
- Added support for split-proof queries for the async client.

### Bugs fixed
- Default consistency level for the sync and async clients is no longer `Session` and will instead be set to the 
  consistency level of the user's cosmos account setting on initialization if not passed during client initialization. 
  This change will impact client application in terms of RUs and latency. Users relying on default `Session` consistency
  will need to pass it explicitly if their account consistency is different than `Session`.
  Please see [Consistency Levels in Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels) for more details.  
- Fixed invalid request body being sent when passing in `serverScript` body parameter to replace operations for trigger, sproc and udf resources.

We will also be removing support for Python 3.6 and will only support Python 3.7+ starting December 2022.

#### Features Added
- Added support for split-proof queries for the sync client.

#### Other Changes
- Added async user agent for async client.

## 4.0.0b4

  within which the operation must be completed. If the timeout value is exceeded, a `azure.cosmos.errors.CosmosClientTimeoutError` will be raised.

Version 4.0.0b2 is the second iteration in our efforts to build a more Pythonic client library.

**Breaking changes**

- The client connection has been adapted to consume the HTTP pipeline defined in `azure.core.pipeline`.
- Interactive objects have now been renamed as proxies. This includes:
    - `Database` -> `DatabaseProxy`
    - `User` -> `UserProxy`
    - `Container` -> `ContainerProxy`
    - `Scripts` -> `ScriptsProxy`
- The constructor of `CosmosClient` has been updated:
    - The `auth` parameter has been renamed to `credential` and will now take an authentication type directly. This means the master key value, a dictionary of resource tokens, or a list of permissions can be passed in. However the old dictionary format is still supported.
    - The `connection_policy` parameter has been made a keyword only parameter, and while it is still supported, each of the individual attributes of the policy can now be passed in as explicit keyword arguments:
        - `request_timeout`
        - `media_request_timeout`
        - `connection_mode`
        - `media_read_mode`
        - `proxy_config`
        - `enable_endpoint_discovery`
        - `preferred_locations`
        - `multiple_write_locations`
- A new classmethod constructor has been added to `CosmosClient` to enable creation via a connection string retrieved from the Azure portal.
- Some `read_all` operations have been renamed to `list` operations:
    - `CosmosClient.read_all_databases` -> `CosmosClient.list_databases`
    - `Container.read_all_conflicts` -> `ContainerProxy.list_conflicts`
    - `Database.read_all_containers` -> `DatabaseProxy.list_containers`
    - `Database.read_all_users` -> `DatabaseProxy.list_users`
    - `User.read_all_permissions` -> `UserProxy.list_permissions`
- All operations that take `request_options` or `feed_options` parameters, these have been moved to keyword only parameters. In addition, while these options dictionaries are still supported, each of the individual options within the dictionary are now supported as explicit keyword arguments.
- The error hierarchy is now inherited from `azure.core.AzureError` instead of `CosmosError` which has been removed.
    - `HTTPFailure` has been renamed to `CosmosHttpResponseError`
    - `JSONParseFailure` has been removed and replaced by `azure.core.DecodeError`
    - Added additional errors for specific response codes:
        - `CosmosResourceNotFoundError` for status 404
        - `CosmosResourceExistsError` for status 409
        - `CosmosAccessConditionFailedError` for status 412
- `CosmosClient` can now be run in a context manager to handle closing the client connection.
- Iterable responses (e.g. query responses and list responses) are now of type `azure.core.paging.ItemPaged`. The method `fetch_next_block` has been replaced by a secondary iterator, accessed by the `by_page` method.

## 4.0.0b1

Version 4.0.0b1 is the first preview of our efforts to create a user-friendly and Pythonic client library for Azure Cosmos. For more information about this, and preview releases of other Azure SDK libraries, please visit https://aka.ms/azure-sdk-preview1-python.

**Breaking changes: New API design**

- Operations are now scoped to a particular client:
    - `CosmosClient`: This client handles account-level operations. This includes managing service properties and listing the databases within an account.
    - `Database`: This client handles database-level operations. This includes creating and deleting containers, users and stored procedures. It can be accessed from a `CosmosClient` instance by name.
    - `Container`: This client handles operations for a particular container. This includes querying and inserting items and managing properties.
    - `User`: This client handles operations for a particular user. This includes adding and deleting permissions and managing user properties.
    
    These clients can be accessed by navigating down the client hierarchy using the `get_<child>_client` method. For full details on the new API, please see the [reference documentation](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-cosmos-ref).
- Clients are accessed by name rather than by Id. No need to concatenate strings to create links.
- No more need to import types and methods from individual modules. The public API surface area is available directly in the `azure.cosmos` package.
- Individual request properties can be provided as keyword arguments rather than constructing a separate `RequestOptions` instance.

## 1.9.0

- Added retry policy support for throttled requests. (Throttled requests receive a request rate too large exception, error code 429.)
  By default, DocumentDB retries nine times for each request when error code 429 is encountered, honoring the retryAfter time in the response header.
  A fixed retry interval time can now be set as part of the RetryOptions property on the ConnectionPolicy object if you want to ignore the retryAfter time returned by server between the retries.
  DocumentDB now waits for a maximum of 30 seconds for each request that is being throttled (irrespective of retry count) and returns the response with error code 429.
  This time can also be overridden in the RetryOptions property on ConnectionPolicy object.

- DocumentDB now returns x-ms-throttle-retry-count and x-ms-throttle-retry-wait-time-ms as the response headers in every request to denote the throttle retry count
  and the cumulative time the request waited between the retries.

- Removed the RetryPolicy class and the corresponding property (retry_policy) exposed on the document_client class and instead introduced a RetryOptions class
  exposing the RetryOptions property on ConnectionPolicy class that can be used to override some of the default retry options.
