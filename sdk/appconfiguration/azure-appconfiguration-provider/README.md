# Azure App Configuration Python Provider client library for Python

Azure App Configuration is a managed service that helps developers centralize their application configurations simply and securely. This provider adds additional functionality above the azure-sdk-for-python.

Using the provider enables loading sets of configurations from an Azure App Configuration store in a managed way.

## Getting started

### Get credentials

Use the [Azure CLI][azure_cli] snippet below to get the connection string from the Configuration Store.

```Powershell
az appconfig credential list --name <config-store-name>
```

Alternatively, get the connection string from the Azure Portal.

### Creating a provider

You can create a client with a connection string:

```python
from azure.appconfiguration.provider import load

config = load(connection_string="your-connection-string")
```

or with AAD:

```python
from azure.appconfiguration.provider import load

config = load(endpoint="your-endpoint", credential=DefaultAzureCredential())
```

these providers will by default load all configurations with `(No Label)` from your configuration store into a dictionary of key/values.

### Features

Currently the Azure App Configuration Provider enables:

* Connecting to an App Configuration Store using a connection string or Azure Active Directory.
* Selecting multiple sets of configurations using `SettingSelector`.
* Dynamic Refresh
* Trim prefixes off key names.
* Resolving Key Vault References, requires AAD.
* Secret Resolver, resolve Key Vault References locally without connecting to Key Vault.
* Json Content Type

#### Future Features

List of features we are going to add to the Python Provider in the future.

* Geo-Replication support
* Feature Management
* Configuration Placeholders

## Examples

### Selecting configurations

You can refine or expand the configurations loaded from your store by using `SettingSelector`s. Setting selectors provide a way to pass a key filter and label filter into the provider.

```python
from azure.appconfiguration.provider import load, SettingSelector
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

selects = {SettingSelector(key_filter="*", label_filter="\0"), SettingSelector(key_filter="*", label_filter="dev")}
config = load(endpoint=endpoint, credential=DefaultAzureCredential(), selects=selects)
```

In this example all configuration with empty label and the dev label are loaded. Because the dev selector is listed last, any configurations from dev take priority over those with `(No Label)` when duplicates are found.

## Dynamic Refresh

The provider can be configured to refresh configurations from the store on a set interval. This is done by providing a `refresh_on` to the provider, which is a list of key(s) that will be watched for changes, and when they do change a refresh can happen. `refresh_interval` is the period of time in seconds between refreshes. `on_refresh_success` is a callback that will be called only if a change is detected and no error happens. `on_refresh_error` is a callback that will be called when a refresh fails.

```python
from azure.appconfiguration.provider import load, WatchKey
import os

connection_string = os.environ.get("APPCONFIGURATION_CONNECTION_STRING")

def my_callback_on_success():
    # Do something on success
    ...

def my_callback_on_fail(error):
    # Do something on fail
    ...

config = load(
    connection_string=connection_string,
    refresh_on=[WatchKey("Sentinel")],
    refresh_interval=60,
    on_refresh_success=my_callback_on_success,
    on_refresh_error=my_callback_on_fail,
    **kwargs,
)
```

In this example, the sentinel key will be checked for changes no sooner than every 60 seconds. In order to check for changes, the provider's `refresh` method needs to be called.

```python
config.refresh()
```

Once the provider is refreshed, the configurations can be accessed as normal. And if any changes have been made it will be updated with the latest values. If the `refresh_interval` hasn't passed since the last refresh check, the provider will not check for changes.

### Trimming Keys

You can trim the prefix off of keys by providing a list of trimmed key prefixes to the provider. For example, if you have the key(s) like `/application/message` in your configuration store, you could trim `/application/` from them.

```python
from azure.appconfiguration.provider import load
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

trim_prefixes={"/application/"}
config = load(endpoint=endpoint, credential=DefaultAzureCredential(), trim_prefixes=trim_prefixes)
print(config["message"])
```

### Resolving Key Vault References

Key Vault References can be resolved by providing credentials to your key vault to the provider using `AzureAppConfigurationKeyVaultOptions`.

#### With Credentials

You can provide `AzureAppConfigurationKeyVaultOptions` with a credential and all key vault references will be resolved with it. The provider will attempt to connect to any key vault referenced with the credential provided.

```python
from azure.appconfiguration.provider import load, AzureAppConfigurationKeyVaultOptions
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

key_vault_options = AzureAppConfigurationKeyVaultOptions(credential=DefaultAzureCredential())
config = load(endpoint=endpoint, credential=DefaultAzureCredential(), key_vault_options=key_vault_options)
```

### With Clients

You can provide `AzureAppConfigurationKeyVaultOptions` with a list of `SecretClients`.

```python
from azure.appconfiguration.provider import load, AzureAppConfigurationKeyVaultOptions
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

key_vault_options = AzureAppConfigurationKeyVaultOptions(
    client_configs={key_vault_uri: {'credential': credential}})
config = load(endpoint=endpoint, credential=DefaultAzureCredential(), key_vault_options=key_vault_options)
```

### Secret Resolver

If no Credentials or Clients are provided a secret resolver can be used. Secret resolver provides a way to return any value you want to a key vault reference.

```python
from azure.appconfiguration.provider import load, AzureAppConfigurationKeyVaultOptions
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

def secret_resolver(uri):
    return "From Secret Resolver"

key_vault_options = AzureAppConfigurationKeyVaultOptions(
    secret_resolver=secret_resolver)
config = load(endpoint=endpoint, credential=DefaultAzureCredential(), key_vault_options=key_vault_options)
```
