# Release History

## 1.1.0b3 (2023-12-19)

### Features Added

- Added on_refresh_success callback to load method. This callback is called when the refresh method successfully refreshes the configuration.

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixes issue where the refresh timer only reset after a change was found.

### Other Changes

- Renamed the type `SentinelKey` to be `WatchKey`.

## 1.1.0b2 (2023-09-29)

New Azure App Configuration Provider

Provides additional support above the Azure App Configuration SDK. Enables:
* Connecting to an Azure App Configuration store
* Selecting multiple keys using Setting Selector
* Resolve Key Vault References when supplied AzureAppConfigurationKeyVaultOptions

The Azure App Configuration Provider once loaded returns a dictionary of key/value pairs to use in configuration.

```python
endpoint = "https://<your-store>.azconfig.io"
default_credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
config = AzureAppConfigurationProvider.load(
    endpoint=endpoint, credential=default_credential)
print(config["message"])
```
